0,"So, I thought — I was trying to think what’s the most useful thing that I – what I can  say that can actually be helpful and useful to you in the future"
1,"And I thought, perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here"
2,"I often find myself wondering, how did this happen"
3,And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Arthur C. Clark which  said that “A sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.’  And that’s really true
4,"If you go back say, 300 years, the things we take for granted today, you’d be burned  at stake for"
5,"Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with  the Internet as a group mind of sorts, and having access to all the world’s information  instantly from almost anywhere on the earth"
6,This stuff that really would be magic – that would be considered magic in times past
7,"In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that, because there are many things that we take  for granted today that weren’t even imagined in times past, that weren’t even in the  realm of magic"
8,"So I thought, well if I can do some of those things – basically if I can advance technology,  then that is like magic and that would be really cool"
9,"I always had an existential crisis, because I was trying to figure out ‘what does it  all mean?’  Like what’s the purpose of things?  And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we  can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we’re better able  to ask the right questions and become more enlightened"
10,"So, I studied physics and business, because I figured in order to do a lot of these things  you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works"
11,And you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create  something
12,"So, I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy  density of electric vehicles – basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced  capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries"
13,"And I thought well I could either pursue this technology, where success may not be one of  the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the Internet and be part  of it"
14,"Fortunately, we’re past graduation, so, I can’t be accused of recommending that  to you"
15,"Maybe it’s helpful to say, one of the things that was important then in the creation of  PayPal was how it started"
16,"Because initially – the initial thought with PayPal was to create a conglomeration  of financial services, so if you have one place where all of your financial services  needs could be seamlessly integrated and works smoothly"
17,"Whenever we’d show the system off to someone, we’d show the hard part, which was the conglomeration  of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together"
18,"Then we showed people e-mail payments, which was quite easy, and everybody was interested"
19,"But, if we hadn’t responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been  successful"
20,"So, it’s important to look for things like that and focus on them when you seem them,  and you correct your prior assumptions"
21,"Going from PayPal, I thought well, what are some of the other problems that are likely  to most affect the future of humanity?  It really wasn’t from the perspective of, ‘what’s the best way to make money,’  which is okay, but it was really ‘what do I think is going to most affect the future  of humanity.’  So, the biggest terrestrial problem we’ve got is sustainable energy"
22,"If we don’t solve that in this century, we’re in deep trouble"
23,And the other one being the extension of life beyond earth to make life multi-planetary
24,So that’s the basis for — the latter is the basis for SpaceX and the former is the  basis for Tesla and SolarCity
25,"When I started SpaceX, initially, I thought that well, there’s no way one could start  a rocket company"
26,"But then, I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA’s budget?  That was actually my initial goal"
27,"I thought well if we could do a low-cost mission to Mars, something called Mars Oasis, which  would land with seeds in dehydrated nutrient gel, then hydrate them upon landing"
28,And you’d have this great short of money shot of green plants on a red background
29,And this would be the first life on Mars and the furthest life had ever traveled as far  as we know
30,So obviously the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero
31,"So, I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM… because that  was the best deal"
32,"And I can tell you it was very weird going there in late 2001-2002 going to the Russian  rocket forces and saying, ‘I’d like to buy two of your biggest rockets, but you can  keep the nuke.’  That’s a lot more"
33,"After making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that… that actually my  initial impression was wrong about – because my initial thought was, well, that there is  not enough will to explore and expand beyond earth and have a Mars base, that kind of thing"
34,"In fact, there’s plenty of will, particularly in the United States"
35,"Because United States is a nation of explorers, so people who came here from other parts of  the world"
36,"But if people think it’s impossible, then well it’s going to completely break the  federal budget, then they’re not going to do it"
37,"So, after my third trip, I said, okay, what we really need to do here is try to solve  the space transport problem and started SpaceX"
38,One friend made sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up
39,Let me tell you he wasn’t far wrong
40,I mean I built like a model rocket as a kid and that kind of thing
41,"So, I had to figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of  people"
42,"Because the thing about a rocket is, the passing grade is 100%"
43,"So, I think to the best analogy for rocket engineers is, if you want to create a really  complicated beta software, you can’t run the software as an integrated whole, and you  can’t run it on the computer, it’s intended to run on"
44,"For the first time you put it all together and run it on that computer, it must run with  no bugs"
45,"So, I think the best analogy for rocket engineers is, if you want to create a really complicated  software, you can’t run the software as an integrated whole, and you can’t run it  on the computer, it’s intended to run on, but the first time you run it on the computer,  it must run with no bugs"
46,"The first launch, I was picking up bits of rocket near the launch site, it was a bit  sad"
47,"And we were able to, eventually with the fourth flight in 2008, reach orbit"
48,"I think the saying is ‘fourth time is the charm?’  So, we got the Falcon 1 to orbit"
49,"And then, began to scale it up to the Falcon 9 which is about an order of magnitude more  thrust, it’s around a million pounds of thrust"
50,"We managed to get that to orbit, and then developed the Dragon spacecraft, which recently  was able to dock and returned to earth from the space station"
51,But there’s lot more that must happen beyond this in order for humanity to become a spacefaring  civilization and ultimately a multi-planet species
52,"It’s worth noting as I’m sure people are aware that Earth has been around for 4 billion  years, but civilization in terms of having writing has been about 10,000 years, and that’s  being generous"
53,"So, it’s really somewhat of a tenuous existence that civilization and consciousness has been  on earth"
54,"But even if it’s 99% likely, a 1% chance is still worth spending a fair bit of effort  to ensure that we have — back up the biosphere, and planetary redundancy if you will"
55,"And in order to do that, there’s breakthrough that needs to occur which is to create a rapidly  and completely reusable transport system to Mars, which is one of those things that’s  right on the borderline of even impossible"
56,But that’s the sort of the thing that we’re going to try to achieve with SpaceX
57,"And then, on the Tesla front, the goal with Tesla was really to try to show what electric  cars can do"
58,"Because people had the wrong impression, and we had to change people’s perceptions of  electric vehicle"
59,"Because they used to think of it as something that was slow and ugly, with low range, like  a golf cart"
60,"So, that’s why we created the Tesla Roadster, to show that it can be fast, attractive and  long range"
61,"And it’s amazing how — even though you can show that something works on paper, and  the calculations are very clear, until you actually have the physical object, and they  can drive it, it doesn’t really sink in for people"
62,"If you’re going to create a company, the first thing you should try to do is create  a working prototype"
63,"But, if you have an actual demonstration article, even if it’s in primitive form, that’s  much more effective in convincing people"
64,"So, we made the Tesla Roadster, and now we’re coming out soon with model S, which is a 4-door  sedan"
65,"Because after we made the Tesla Roadster people said, ‘oh sure, sure we always knew you  could make a car like that, it’s an expensive car and it’s low volume and small and all  that but can you make a real car?’  Okay, fine, we’re going to make that, too"
66,I think the overreaching point I want to make is that: You guys are the magicians of the  21st century
67," I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity? I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production"
68," That sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century, independent of environmental concerns"
69," In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment, given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons, we need to find some sustainable means of operating"
70," One is that, even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off"
71," So if you take, say, natural gas, which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel, if you burn that in a modern General Electric natural gas turbine, you'll get about 60 percent efficiency"
72," If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car, you get about 20 percent efficiency"
73," And the reason is, in the stationary power plant, you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more, is voluminous, and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source"
74," So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything, even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant"
75," And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway, electricity generation"
76," So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation, then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport"
77," So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport, and I should say that I think, actually, all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets"
78, There's just no way around Newton's third law
79," The question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport? And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with a really energy efficient car, so that means making it incredibly light, and so what you're seeing here is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car made in North America"
80," In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack"
81, And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size
82," So as a result, the energy usage is very low, and it has the most advanced battery pack, and that's what gives it the range that's competitive, so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range"
83," The rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack, and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range"
84," And in fact, customers of the Model S are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range"
85," In creating an electric car, the responsiveness of the car is really incredible"
86," So we wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car, so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one, and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens, like the car has ESP"
87," I think that's really a profound difference, and people only experience that when they have a test drive"
88," The goal of Tesla has always been to have a sort of three-step process, where version one was an expensive car at low volume, version two is medium priced and medium volume, and then version three would be low price, high volume"
89," Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars"
90," And our third generation car, which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a $30,000 car"
91," But whenever you've got really new technology, it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass-market product"
92," And so I think we're making progress in that direction, and I feel confident that we'll get there"
93," There actually are far more charging stations than people realize, and at Tesla we developed something called a Supercharging technology, and we're offering that if you buy a Model S for free, forever"
94," We actually have California and Nevada covered, and we've got the Eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C"
95," By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive from L.A"
96," to New York just using the Supercharger network, which charges at five times the rate of anything else"
97," And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop, to stop time, of about six or seven"
98," So if you drive for three hours, you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes, because that's normally what people will stop for"
99," So if you start a trip at 9 a.m., by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat, hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going"
100," Actually, what we're expecting is for people to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour"
101," It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going"
102," Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption, so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar"
103," We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun, and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization"
104, What most people know but don't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already
105," If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin, and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation"
106," Well actually, I'm confident that solar will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas"
107," And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs, so once it's installed, it's just there"
108," And we've made huge progress in that direction, and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas"
109," Typical leases are 20 years, but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward"
110," Well, essentially, SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say, a company or a bank"
111," With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill"
112," I think it's a good thing, because utilities have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice"
113," So effectively it's the first time there's been competition for this monopoly, because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof"
114," I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power, and most likely a majority, and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years"
115," I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago, so in roughly 18 years, I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source"
116," People would say, ""Did you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry?"" Obviously, ""He started with a large one,"" is the punchline"
117," And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one"
118," We came very close to failure, but we managed to get through that point in 2008"
119," The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology, and in particular to try to crack a problem that I think is vital for humanity to become a space-faring civilization, which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket"
120," I did build rockets when I was a kid, but I didn't think I'd be involved in this"
121," It was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one? And I really think there's a fundamental difference, if you sort of look into the future, between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization, that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets, and I think that's really exciting, compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event"
122," Well, we've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe, the engines, the electronics and the launch operation"
123," Since our primary competitors are national governments, the enforceability of patents is questionable"
124," The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket, but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time, and the parts that were reusable took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight"
125, So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight
126," So it's important that the rocket stages be able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours"
127,"  And so what a lot of people don't realize is, the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small"
128," So it's possible to achieve, let's say, roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket"
129," Every mode of transport that we use, whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses, is reusable, but not rockets"
130, So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization
131," We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project, where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight, the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky"
132, We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket
133," (Rocket launch) So now it's hovering at about 40 meters, and it's constantly adjusting the angle, the pitch and yaw of the main engine, and maintaining roll with cold gas thrusters"
134," Through most of our life, we get through life by reasoning by analogy, which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations"
135," Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics"
136," So I think that's an important thing to do, and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback, and solicit it, particularly from friends"
137," This may sound like simple advice, but hardly anyone does that, and it's incredibly helpful"
138," We're trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefullybe a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion"
139, So a couple of key thingsthat are important in having a 3D tunnel network
140," First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entranceand exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city"
141," So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate,that's on an elevator, you can integrate the entranceand exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces"
142," There's no speed limit here, so we're designing this to be ableto operate at 200 kilometers an hour"
143," 200 kilometers an hour,or about 130 miles per hour"
144," So, I don't knowif people noticed it in the video, but there's no real limitto how many levels of tunnel you can have"
145," The deepest mines are much deeperthan the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrarylevel of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network"
146," So a key rebuttal to the tunnelsis that if you add one layer of tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion,it will get used up, and then you'll be back where you started,back with congestion"
147, So it's roughly a billion dollars a mileto do the subway extension in LA
148, I think we need to haveat least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling
149," Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximatelyan order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that"
150, So the first thing to dois to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more
151," So a single road lane tunnelaccording to regulations has to be 26 feet,maybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashesand emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilationfor combustion engine cars"
152," But if you shrink that diameterto what we're attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plentyto get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional areaby a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scaleswith the cross-sectional area"
153," Then tunneling machines currently tunnelfor half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the timeis putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall"
154," So if you design the machine instead to do continuoustunneling and reinforcing, that will give youa factor of two improvement"
155," Also these machines are far from beingat their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the powerto the machine substantially"
156," I think you can getat least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or fiveimprovement on top of that"
157," This is not some inherent biasagainst flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they'll be quite noisy, the wind force generatedwill be very high"
158," Let's just say that if something'sflying over your head, a whole bunch of flying carsgoing all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation"
159,"  You don't think to yourself,""Well, I feel better about today."" You're thinking,""Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come offand guillotine me?"" Things like that"
160," Yeah, so we've beensort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while"
161," We built a Hyperloop test trackadjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovativeideas in transport"
162," And it actually ends up beingthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume"
163, So we're cautiously optimistic we'll be able to be fasterthan the world's fastest bullet train even in a .8-mile stretch
164," So actually, it sort of turns outthat automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enoughto resist the water table, it is automaticallycapable of holding vacuum"
165," I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop, I think you'd probably wantto go underground the entire way because it's a high-density area"
166," You're going undera lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel"
167," Sometimes people think,well, it's going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house"
168," Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or fourtunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be ableto detect it being dug at all"
169," In fact, if you're ableto detect the tunnel being dug, whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of moneyfor that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detecttunnels from Hamas, and from the US Customs and Border patrolthat try and detect drug tunnels"
170," So the reality is that earth is incredibly goodat absorbing vibrations, and once the tunnel depthis below a certain level, it is undetectable"
171," A lot of people thinkthat when you make cars autonomous, they'll be able to go fasterand that will alleviate congestion"
172," And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomywhere it's much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a carwill be better than that of a bus"
173," So the amount of driving that will occurwill be much greater with shared autonomy, and actually traffic will get far worse"
174," And some, amazingly,are still pursuing fuel cells, but I think that won't last much longer"
175," I intend to stay with Teslaas far into the future as I can imagine, and there are a lot of excitingthings that we have coming"
176, So there's no LIDARor radar being used here
177," This is just using passive optical,which is essentially what a person uses"
178," The whole road systemis meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras, and so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved"
179, So that's why our focus isso heavily on having a vision neural net that's very effective for road conditions
180," Like, you can probably do itten times better than humans would, just cameras"
181," I think we're still on trackfor being able to go cross-country from LA to New York by the endof the year, fully autonomous"
182," Essentially,November or December of this year, we should be able to go all the wayfrom a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any pointduring the entire journey"
183," Yes, but the thingthat will be interesting is that I'm actually fairly confidentit will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically"
184," We could change itand make it Seattle-Florida, that day, in real time"
185," So the real trick of itis not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent of the time, because, like, if a car crashesone in a thousand times, then you're probably still not goingto be comfortable falling asleep"
186," Well, I think that the autonomy systemis likely to at least mitigate the crash, except in rare circumstances"
187," I mean, there's some chance that any timea human driver gets in a car, that they will have an accidentthat is their fault"
188, So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomyneed to be than a person before you can rely on it?
189," So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can chooseto use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be usedonly by friends and family, only by other driverswho are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimesbut not other times"
190," They think the truck doesn't have enoughpower or it doesn't have enough range, and then with the Tesla Semi we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi"
191," And if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla Semiwill tug the diesel semi uphill"
192," So what will bereally fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curvewith an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kindof internal combustion engine car, you've got a torque RPM curvethat looks like a hill"
193," It's really weird,because you're driving around and you're just so nimble,and you're in this giant truck"
194," It's just like,driving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers"
195," If you look in betweenthe electric car and the house, there are actually three Powerwallsstacked up against the side of the house, and then that house roof is a solar roof"
196," Solar glass tiles where you can adjustthe texture and the color to a very fine-grained level, and then there'ssort of microlouvers in the glass, such that when you're lookingat the roof from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cellbehind it or not"
197," If you were to look at itfrom a helicopter, you would be actually ableto look through and see that some of the glass tiles havea solar cell behind them and some do not"
198," Well after the house has collapsed and there's nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there"
199," Yeah, we're starting offwith two, two initially, and the second twowill be introduced early next year"
200, The thing is to considerthe time scale here to be probably on the order of 40 or 50 years
201," So on average, a roofis replaced every 20 to 25 years"
202," But eventually,if you say were to fast-forward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a roofthat does not have solar"
203," It depends on where you are and what the house size isrelative to the roof area, but it's a fair statement to say that most houses in the UShave enough roof area to power all the needs of the house"
204," Eventually, you can sort of roughly see that there's sort ofa diamond shape overall, and when it's fully done,it'll look like a giant diamond, or that's the idea behind it, and it's aligned on true north"
205," A hundred gigawatt hours.We think probably more, but yeah"
206," Well, when it's running at full speed, you can't actually see the cellswithout a strobe light"
207, I think we'll announce locations for somewhere between twoand four Gigafactories later this year
208," Well, I think that first of all, I'm just on two advisory councils where the format consistsof going around the room and asking people's opinion on things, and so there's like a meetingevery month or two"
209," But I think to the degreethat there are people in the room who are arguing in favorof doing something about climate change, or social issues, I've used the meetings I've had thus far to argue in favor of immigrationand in favor of climate change"
210," So maybe nothing will happen,but at least the words were said"
211, So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back fromvery high and fast in space
212," I think this might have beenat sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage"
213," Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight againand flew it again, so it's the first reflightof an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant"
214, So it's important to appreciatethat reusability is only relevant if it is rapid and complete
215,"  In units of 747, a 747 is only abouta quarter of a million pounds of thrust, so for every 10 million pounds of thrust, there's 40 747s"
216, I'm hopeful it's sort ofan eight- to 10-year time frame
217," While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparisonwith other rockets, I think the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat"
218," Like, why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we're not out there, if the future does not includebeing out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it's incredibly depressing if that's not the futurethat we're going to have"
219," It's like a branchingstream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can takethat affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thingor slow down another thing"
220," If there was no Tesla,if Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity"
221," If you don't have sustainable energy,it means you have unsustainable energy"
222," Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economicswill drive civilization towards sustainable energy, inevitably"
223," The fundamental valueof a company like Tesla is the degree to which it acceleratesthe advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur"
224," So when I think, like, what is the fundamental goodof a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade,potentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur"
225," The sustainable energy futureI think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilizationis definitely not inevitable"
226," If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 you were ableto send somebody to the moon"
227," Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United Statescould take no one to orbit"
228," It only improves if a lot of peoplework very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think,by itself degrade, actually"
229," You look at great civilizationslike Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that"
230," I think the valueof beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question"
231," But you'll tell me if it everstarts getting genuinely insane, right? "
232," And what I really want to achieve here is to make Mars seem possible, make it seem as though it's something that we can do in our lifetimes and that you can go"
233, And is there really a way that anyone can go if they wanted to? I think that's really the important thing
234," So, I mean, first of all, why go anywhere? Right? I think there are really two fundamental paths"
235, One path is we stay on Earth forever and then there will be some eventual extinction event
236," I don't have an immediate doomsday prophecy, but eventually history suggests there will be some doomsday event"
237," The alternative is to become a space-faring civilization and a multiplanet species, which I hope you agree that is the right way to go"
238," But you can get a sense for the real scale of the solar system, how big the sun is and Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus"
239," This sort of helps to see, it's not quite to scale, but it gives you a better sense for where things are"
240," We have, in terms of nearby options, we've got Venus"
241," We could go potentially on to one of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, but those are quite far out, much further from the sun, a lot harder to get to"
242," Really, it leaves us with one option if we want to become a multiplanet civilization, and that's Mars"
243," We could conceivably go to our moon, and I have nothing against going to the moon, but I think it's challenging to become multiplanetary on the moon because it's much smaller than a planet"
244," It has a 28-day day, whereas the Mars day is 24 1/2 hours"
245," And in general, Mars is far better suited to ultimately scale up to a self-sustaining civilization"
246," In fact, we now believe that early Mars was a lot like Earth"
247," So, where things are right now, Mars is about half again as far from the sun as Earth"
248," It has a very helpful atmosphere which, in the case of Mars being primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace elements, means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere"
249," And it has nitrogen, too, which is also very important for growing plants"
250," It will be quite fun to be on Mars, because you will have gravity which is about 37% that of Earth, so you will be able to lift heavy things and bound around and have a lot of fun"
251," So we just need to change that bottom row, because currently we have 7 billion people on Earth and zero on Mars"
252," So there's been a lot of great work by NASA and other organizations in early exploration of Mars and understanding what Mars is like, where could we land, what's the composition of the atmosphere, where is there water, or ice, we should say"
253, And we need to go from these early exploration missions to actually building a city
254," The issue that we have today is that if you look at a Venn diagram, there's no intersection of sets of people who want to go and can afford to go"
255," In fact, right now you cannot go to Mars for infinite money"
256," Using traditional methods, you know, if taking sort of a holistic style approach, an optimistic cost number would be about $10 billion per person"
257," For example, the Apollo program, the cost estimates are somewhere between $100 billion to $200 billion in current-year dollars, and we sent 12 people to the surface of the moon, which was an incredible thing and I think probably one of the greatest achievements of humanity"
258, That's why these circles only just barely touch
259, So you can't create a self-sustaining civilization if the ticket price is $10 billion a person
260," And if we can get the cost of moving to Mars to be roughly equivalent to a median house price in the U.S., which is around $200,000, then I think the probability of establishing a self-sustaining civilization is very high"
261," And I think it gets to the point where almost anyone, if they saved up and this was their goal, they could ultimately save up enough money to buy a ticket and move to Mars"
262, And Mars would have labor shortage for a long time so jobs would not be in short supply
263, But it is a bit tricky because we have to figure out how to improve the cost of trips to Mars by 5 million percent
264, This translates to an improvement of approximately 4 1/2 orders of magnitude
265, These are the key elements that are needed in order to achieve the 4 1/2 order of magnitude improvement
266," Most of the improvement would come from full reusability, somewhere between 2 and 2 1/2 orders of magnitude"
267," And then the other two orders of magnitude would come from refilling in orbit, propellant production on Mars and choosing the right propellant"
268," It's very difficult to achieve reusability for even an orbital system, and that challenge becomes even substantially greater for a system that has to go to another planet"
269," If they were single-use, almost no one would use them"
270," But with frequent flights, you can take something like an aircraft that costs $90 million and if it was single use, you would have to pay half a million dollars per flight"
271, So you get to use the spaceship part roughly every two years
272," Without refilling in orbit, you would have a half order of magnitude impact roughly on the cost"
273," By ""half order of magnitude,"" I think the audience mostly knows, but what that means is each order of magnitude is a factor of ten"
274," So not refilling in orbit would mean a 500%, roughly, increase in the cost per ticket"
275," It also allows us to build a smaller vehicle and lower the development cost, although this vehicle is quite big"
276, But it would be much harder to build something that's five to ten times the size
277, And it also reduces the sensitivity of performance characteristics of the booster rocket and tanker
278," So if there's a shortfall in the performance of any of the elements, you can actually make up for it by having one or two extra refilling trips to the spaceship"
279, And it would be pretty absurd to try to build a city on Mars if your spaceships just kept staying on Mars and not going back to Earth
280, You really want to build a propellant plant on Mars and send the ships back
281," So and Mars happens to work out well for that because it has a CO2 atmosphere, it's got water rights in the soil, and with H2O and CO2 you can produce CH4, methane, and oxygen, O2"
282," And they have their merits, but kerosene or rocket propellant-grade kerosene which is also what jets use"
283, Rockets use a very expensive form of highly refined form of jet fuel essentially which is a form of kerosene
284," It helps keep the vehicle size small, but because it's a very specialized form of jet fuel, it's quite expensive"
285," Hydrogen, although it has a high specific impulse, is very expensive, incredibly difficult to keep from boiling off because liquid hydrogen is very close to absolute zero as a liquid"
286," So when we looked at the overall system optimization, it was clear to us that methane actually was the clear winner"
287, So it would require maybe anywhere from 50 to 60% of the energy on Mars to refill propellants using the propellant depot
288," And we started off initially thinking that hydrogen would make sense, but ultimately came to the conclusion that the best way to optimize the cost per unit mass to Mars and back is to use an all-methane system, or technically deep-cryo Methalox"
289," In the video, you got a sense for what this system mock architecture looks like"
290," The rocket booster and the spaceship take off, loads the spaceship into orbit"
291," It comes back quite quickly, within about 20 minutes"
292," This also helps slow the development cost, which obviously will not be small"
293," You would ultimately have, I think, upwards of a thousand or more spaceships waiting in orbit"
294, But it actually makes sense to load the spaceships into orbit because you have got two years to do so and then make frequent use of the booster and the tanker to get really heavy reuse out of those
295," And then with the spaceship you get less reuse because you have to prepare for how long is it going to last? Well, maybe 30 years"
296, So that might be 12 to maybe 15 flights with the spaceship at most
297," So the ship goes to Mars, gets replenished, and then returns to Earth"
298," The funny thing is in the long-term, the ships will be even bigger than this"
299, This will be relatively small compared to the Mars interplanetary ships of the future
300," But it kind of needs to be about this size because in order to fit a hundred people or thereabouts in the pressurized section plus carry the luggage and all of the unpressurized cargo to build propellant plants and build everything from iron foundries to pizza joints to you name it, we need to carry a lot of cargo"
301," If you only go every two years, if you have a hundred people per ship, that's 10,000 trips"
302," So I think at least a hundred people per trip is the right order of magnitude, and I think we may actually end up expanding the crew section and ultimately taking more like 200 or more people per flight in order to reduce the cost per person"
303," And so I think if you say, When would we reach that million-person threshold? From the point at which the first ship goes to Mars, it's probably somewhere between 20 to 50 total Mars rendezvous"
304, So it's probably somewhere between maybe 40 to 100 years to achieve a fully self-sustaining civilization on Mars
305, The carbon fiber part is tricky when dealing with deep cryogens and trying to achieve both liquid and gas impermeability and not have gaps occur due to cracking or pressurization that would make the carbon fiber leaky
306," So this is a fairly significant technical challenge, to make deep and cryogenic tanks out of carbon fiber"
307," And it's only recently that we think the carbon fiber technology has gotten to the point where we can actually do this without having to create a liner, some sort of metal liner, quad liner on the inside of the tanks, which would add mass and complexity"
308," So this is designed to be autogenously pressurized, which means that the fuel and the oxygen, we gasify them through heat exchanges in the engine and use that to pressurize the tanks"
309," This is a much simpler system than what we have with Falcon 9, where we use helium for pressurization and we use nitrogen for gas thrusters"
310," In this case, we would autogenously pressurize and then use gaseous methane and oxygen for the control thrusters"
311," So really, you only need two ingredients for this, as opposed to four in the case of Falcon 9 and actually five if you consider the ignition liquid"
312," So this gives you a sense of vehicles by performance, sort of current and historic"
313," But in expandable mode, the vehicle, of course, we are proposing would do about 550 tons and about 300 tons in reusable mode"
314, That compares to satisfy max capability of 135 tons
315," The white bars show the performance of the vehicle; in other words, the payload-to-orbit of the vehicle"
316, So you can see essentially what it represents is what's the size efficiency of the vehicle
317, So it's the first time a rocket's sort of performance bar will actually exceed the physical size of the rocket
318," And in the future, we expect to add additional launch locations, probably adding one on the south coast of Texas"
319," This is really intended to carry huge numbers of people, ultimately millions of tons of cargo to Mars"
320, So talk about some of the key elements of the interplanetary spaceship and rocket booster
321, We decided to start off the development with what we think are probably the two most difficult elements of the design
322, And this is going to be the highest chamber pressure engine of any kind ever built and probably the highest thrust-to-weight
323, It's a full-flow staged combustion engine which maximizes the theoretical momentum that you can get out of a given source fuel and oxidizer
324," In our case, we actually build the propellants close to their freezing point"
325," That can result in a density improvement of up to around 10 to 12%, which makes an enormous difference in the actual results of the rocket"
326," Really one of the keys here, though, is the vacuum version of Raptor having a 382-second ISP"
327, This is really quite critical too to the whole Mars mission
328," And we can get to that number or at least within a few seconds of that number, ultimately maybe exceeding it slightly"
329, So the rocket booster in many ways is really a scaled-up version of the Falcon 9 booster
330, And the big difference really being that the primary structure is an advanced form of carbon fiber as opposed to limited lithium and that we use autogenous pressurization and get rid of the helium and the nitrogen
331," And with Falcon Heavy, which should launch early next year, there's 27 engines on the base"
332, So we've got pretty good experience with having a large number of engines
333, But the main job of the booster is to accelerate the spaceship to around 8 1/2 thousand kilometers an hour
334," For those that are less familiar with orbital dynamics, really it's all about velocity and not about height"
335, No booster is needed on the moon or Mars or any of the moons of Jupiter or Pluto
336, And then we've also been able to optimize the propellant needed for boost-back and landing to get it down to about 7% of the liftoff prop propellant load
337, And we also are now getting quite comfortable with the accuracy of the landing
338," If you have been watching the Falcon 9 landings, you will see that they are getting increasingly closer too to the bull's-eye"
339, And then those fins at the base are essentially centering features to take out any minor position mismatch at the launch site
340, So we think we only need to gimbal or steer the center cluster of engines
341," And, like, this is all designed so that you could actually lose multiple engines even at liftoff or anywhere in flight and continue the mission safely"
342, The liquid oxygen tank is probably the hardest piece of this whole vehicle because it's got to handle propellant at the coldest level and the tanks themselves actually form the air frame
343," So the air frame structure and the tank structure are combined, as it is in all modern rockets"
344," And in aircraft, for example, the wing is really a fuel tank in wing shape"
345," So it has to take the thrust loads of ascents, the loads of reentry, and then it has to be impermeable to gaseous oxygen, which is tricky, and non-reactive to gaseous oxygen"
346," So that's the hardest piece of the spaceship itself, which is actually why we started on that element as well"
347," And then below the oxygen tank is the fuel tank, and then the engines are mounted directly to the thrust cone on the base"
348, And then there are three of the sea-level versions of the engine which do gimbal and provide the steering
349, Although we can do some amount of steering if you're in space with differential thrust on the outside engines
350," The net effect is a cargo to Mars of up to 450 tons, depending upon how many refills you do with the tanker"
351," This chart is a little difficult to interpret at first, but we decided to put it there for people who wanted to watch the video afterwards and sort of take a closer look and analyze some of the numbers"
352," So depending upon which Earth-Mars rendezvous you are aiming for, the trip time at 6 kilometers per second departure blast speed can be as low as 80 days"
353," Ultimately, I suspect that you would see Mars transit times of as little as 30 days in the more distant future"
354," It's fairly manageable, considering the trips that people used to do in the old days would routinely take sailing voyages that would be six months or more"
355, We have been refining the heat shield technology using our Dragon spacecraft
356," We are now on version 3 of PICA, which is the phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator"
357," And it's getting more and more robust with each new version, with less ablation, more resistance, less need for refurbishment"
358, How it's like how good can you make that brake pad against the extreme conditions and the cost of refurbishment and make it so you could have many flights with no refurbishment at all
359," I mean, in order to make it appealing and increase that portion of the Venn diagram of people who actually want to go, it's got to be really fun and exciting, and it can't feel cramped or boring"
360," But the crew compartment or the occupant compartment is set up so you can do zero-G things, you can float around"
361," So the propellant plant on Mars, again, this is one of those slides that I won't go into in detail here, but people can take that offline"
362," The key point being that the ingredients are there on Mars to create a propellant plant with relative ease, because the atmosphere is primarily CO2 and there's water ice almost everywhere"
363, You've got the CO2 plus H2O to make methane CH4 and oxygen O2 using the Sabatier reaction
364," The trickiest thing really is the energy source, which think we can do with a large field of solar panels"
365," So then to give you a sense of the cost, really the key is making this affordable to almost anyone who wants to go"
366," And we think, based on this architecture, this architecture, assuming optimization over time, like the very first flights would be fairly expensive"
367," So we're right now estimating about $140,000 per ton to the trips to Mars"
368," So if a person plus their luggage is less than that, take into account food consumption and life support, then we think that the cost of moving to Mars ultimately could drop below $100,000"
369," So we have steel underpants; launch satellites; send cargo to space station; Kickstarter, of course; followed by profit"
370," We do expect to generate pretty decent net cash flow from launching lots of satellites and serving the space station for NASA, transferring cargo to and from space station, and then I know there's a lot of people in the private sector who are interested in helping fund a base on Mars and then perhaps there will be interest on the government sector side to also do that"
371, And right now we're just trying to make as much progress as we can with the resources that we have available and just sort of keep moving both forward
372, And I should say also the main reason I'm personally accumulating assets is in order to fund this
373, So I really don't have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets except to be able to make the biggest contribution I can to making life multiplanetary
374," In 2002, SpaceX basically consisted of carpet and a mariachi band"
375," And, yeah, I believe in kicking off celebratory events with mariachi bands"
376," And really, I mean, I thought we had maybe a 10% chance of doing anything, of even getting a rocket to orbit, let alone getting beyond that and taking Mars seriously"
377," But I came to the conclusion if there wasn't some new entrant into the space arena with a strong ideological motivation, then it didn't seem like we were on a trajectory to ever be a space-faring civilization and be out there among the stars"
378," Because, you know, in '69 we were able to go to the moon and the space shuttle could get to low-Earth orbit, and then after the space shuttle got retired"
379, It only improves if a lot of really strong engineering talent is applied to the problem that it improves
380, And there are many examples in history where civilizations have reached a certain technology level and then have fallen well below that and then recovered only millennia later
381," So we dropped the main engine, the upper stage engine, the air frames, the fairing and the launch system and had our first attempt at launch in 2006, which failed"
382," But it's 2006, four years after starting, is also when we actually got our first NASA contract"
383," And I just want to say I'm incredibly grateful to NASA for supporting SpaceX, you know, despite the fact that our rocket crashed"
384," And then, finally, the fourth launch of Falcon 1 worked in 2008"
385," In fact, I only thought I had enough money for three launches and the first three bloody failed"
386, And we were able to scrape together enough to just barely make it and do a fourth launch
387," And then also at the end of 2008 is when NASA awarded us the first major operational contract, which was for resupplying cargo to the space station and bringing cargo back"
388," Then a couple years later we did the first launch of Falcon 9, version 1"
389," So it was about 20 times the capability of Falcon 1, and also was assigned to carry our Dragon spacecraft"
390, Then 2010 is our first mission to the space station
391, So we were able to finish development of Dragon and dock with the space station in 2010
392, 2012 is when we delivered and returned cargo from the space station
393, 2013 is when we first started doing boat take-off and landing tests
394, And then 2014 is when we were able to have the first orbital booster do a soft landing in the ocean
395, And we also improved the capability of the vehicle from 10 tons to about 13 tons to LEO
396," And then 2015, last year, in December, that was definitely one of the best moments of my life when the rocket booster came back and landed at Cape Canaveral"
397, So that really showed that we could bring an orbit-class booster back from a very high velocity all the way to the launch site and land it safely and with almost no refurbishment required for reflight
398," And if things go well, we're hoping to refly one of the landed boosters in a few months"
399, And that's important for reusability of Falcon 9 because about roughly a quarter of our missions are sort of servicing the space station
400," But most of our missions, probably 60% of our missions, are commercial geo missions"
401, So we've got to do these high-velocity missions that really need to land on a ship out to sea
402, They don't have enough propellants on board to boost back to the launch site
403," So looking into the future, next steps, we were kind of intentionally a bit fuzzy about this time line"
404," But we are going to try to make as much progress as we can on the elements of interplanetary transport booster and spaceship, and hopefully we'll be able to complete the first development spaceship in maybe about four years and start doing suborbital flights with that"
405," In fact, it has enough capability that you could maybe even go to orbit if you limit the amount of cargo with the spaceship"
406," Actually, I was thinking like maybe there is some market for really fast transport of stuff around the world, provided we can land somewhere where noise is not a super big deal, because rockets are very noisy"
407, But we could transport cargo to anywhere on Earth in 45 minutes at the longest
408," So most places on Earth would be maybe 20, 25 minutes"
409," Really most of your time would be getting to the ship, and then it would be real quick after that"
410," But then trying to put it all together and make this actually work to Mars, if things go super well, it might be kind of in the ten-year time frame"
411," Good chance we don't succeed, but we're going to do our best and try to make as much progress as possible"
412, And we're going to try to send something to Mars on every Mars rendezvous from here on out
413," So Dragon 2, which is a propulsive lander, we plan to send to Mars in a couple years, and then do probably another Dragon mission in 2020"
414," In fact, we want to establish a steady cadence, that there's always a flight leaving, like there's a train leaving the station"
415," So if there's a lot of interest in putting payloads on Dragon, you know you can count on a ship that's going to transport something on the order of at least two or three tons of useful payloads to the surface of Mars"
416," That's part of the reason we designed Dragon 2, to be a propulsive lander"
417," And then anyplace that doesn't have a dense atmosphere, you can't use parachutes"
418, So the Dragon should be capable of landing on any solid or liquid surface in the solar system
419," I just want to say thanks to the Raptor team for really working seven days a week to try to get this done in advance of the presentation, because I really wanted to show that we've made some hardware progress in this direction"
420," It's a lot trickier than Merlin because it's a full-flow stage combustion, much higher pressure"
421, I'm kind of amazed it didn't blow up on the first firing
422," And part of the reason for making the engine sort of small, Raptor, although it has three times the thrust of a Merlin is only about the same size as a Merlin engine because it has three times the operating pressure"
423, That means we can use a lot of the production techniques that we've honed with Merlin
424, We are currently producing Merlin engines at almost 300 per year
425, And this is a similarly sized engine to Merlin except for the expansion ratio
426, So we feel really comfortable about being able to make this engine in volume at a price that doesn't break our budget
427," So, as I mentioned, this is really a very difficult thing to make, to make something out of carbon fiber"
428," Just the sheer scale of it is also challenging, because you've got to lay out the carbon fiber in exactly the right way on a huge mold, and you've got to cure that mold at temperature"
429, So that's the other thing we want to focus on is the Raptor and then building the first development tank for the Mars spaceship
430," You get a size for how big the tank is, which is really quite big"
431, They were also working seven days a week to try to get this done in advance of the IAC
432," We managed to build the first tank, and the initial tests with the cryogenic propellants actually look quite positive"
433," It's actually completely smooth on the inside, but the way that the carbon fiber plies lay out and reflect the light makes it look faceted"
434," There's obviously the rocket booster, the spaceship, the tanker, and the propellant plant, the in situ propellant production"
435," If you have all of those four elements, you can actually go anywhere in the solar system by planet hopping or moon hopping"
436, And I’m having a really great time with my kids in Dubai
437," I really encourage anyone who hasn’t been to visit, what a great city! Thank you"
438,"And, in terms of the motivations, I used to like this sort of… kind of a long version of the explanation but… essentially, when I was a kid I was wondering, what’s the meaning of life? Like, why are we here? What is it all about? And I came to the conclusion that what really matters is trying to understand the right questions to ask"
439," And the more that we can increase the scope and scale of human consciousness, the better we’re able to ask these questions"
440, And… some of those things are in the long term having long term sustainable transport and sustainable energy generation
441, I think that being a multi-planetary species and being out there among the stars is important for the long-term survival of humanity
442," And, that’s one reason, kind of like life insurance for life collectively"
443," But then the part that I find personally most motivating is that it creates a sense of adventure, and it makes people excited about the future"
444," If you consider two futures, one where we are forever confined to Earth until eventually something terrible happens"
445," Or another future where we are out there on many planets, maybe even going beyond the solar system"
446," Otherwise, what’s the point? There’s got to be things that people find inspiring and make life worth living"
447,I find that as I get older I find that question to be maybe more and more confusing or troubling or uncertain
448, Particularly when you see the advancement of something like video games
449," You know, 40 years ago, you had video games, the most advanced video game would be like Pong, when you had two rectangles and a dot"
450," But now, you can see a video game that’s photo-realistic, almost photo-realistic, and millions of people playing simultaneously"
451," And augmented reality and… if you extrapolate that out into the future with any rate of progress at all, like keeping 0.1% of something like that a year, then eventually those games will be indistinguishable from reality"
452, They’ll be so realistic you won’t be able to tell the difference between that game and reality as we know it
453," And then, it seems like, well, how do we know that that didn’t happen in the past? And that we’re not in one of those games ourselves"
454," When you think of, say, the first controlled power flight was in 1903 with the Wright Brothers"
455," And then, 66 years later we put the first people on the moon"
456," I mean, if you asked people, say, in 1900, what are the odds of landing on the moon they would’ve said that’s ridiculous"
457," If you try to talk to them about the internet they wouldn’t know what the heck you’re even… What are you talking about? Like, this sounds so crazy"
458," On the other side of the world, and if you have a Wi-Fi connection, it’s basically free"
459," You’re free to have an instant visual communication with anyone, or even with millions of people"
460," It’s like an oracle of wisdom, that you can ask almost any questions and get an instant response"
461," So, I think the one thing that we can be quite certain of is that any predictions we make today for what the future will be like in 50 years will be wrong That’s for sure"
462," I think directionally, I can tell you what I hope the future has, as opposed to maybe what it will be"
463,"I mean I hope we are out there on Mars and maybe beyond Mars, Jupiter"
464," I hope we’re traveling frequently throughout the solar system, perhaps preparing for missions to nearby star systems"
465," And, I think we’ll see autonomy and artificial intelligence advance tremendously"
466," My guess is in probably 10 years, it will be very unusual for cars to be built that are not fully autonomous"
467, I think almost all cars built will be able of full autonomy in about 10 years
468," As it is, the Tesla cars that are made today, have the sensor system necessary for full autonomy"
469, And we think probably enough compute power to be safer than a person
470," And if it turns out that more compute power is needed, we can easily upgrade the computer"
471," And, so that’s all Teslas built since October last year"
472," You just tell it where you want to go, and it takes you there with extreme levels of safety"
473," Now, you just get in, you press the button and that’s taken for granted"
474," And I don’t mean narrow AI, like, vehicle autonomy I would put in the narrow AI class"
475," But deep artificial intelligence, or what is sometimes called artificial general intelligence, where you can have AI that is much smarter than the smartest human on Earth"
476," But my question is, do you think there is other intelligent life outside the Earth? It seems probable"
477," I think this is one of the great questions in physics and philosophy, is, where are the aliens? Maybe they are among us, I don’t know"
478," If there are super intelligent aliens out there, they’re probably already observing us"
479, That would seem quite likely and we’re not smart enough to realize it
480," But I can do some back of the envelope calculations and… any advanced alien civilization that is at all interested in populating the galaxy, even without exceeding the speed of light, even if you’re only moving at, say, 10 or 20 per cent of the speed of light, you could populate the entire galaxy in let’s say 10 million years"
481," It’s like, if… we’re all going to die someday, and if you’re going to pick some place to die, then why not Mars? You know, if you’re born on Earth, why not die on Mars? Seems like may be quite exciting"
482," But, I think given the choice between dying on Earth and dying on Mars, I’d say, yeah, sure, I’ll die on Mars"
483," I think this is going to sound a little… I mean, it seems like so much trivial or silly, but… I’ve been saying this for many years now, but I think that the solution to urban congestion is a network of tunnels under cities"
484," And when I say that I don’t mean a 2-D plan of tunnels, I mean tunnels that go many levels deep"
485," Like, the deepest mines are deeper than the tallest buildings"
486," So, you can have a network of tunnels that is 20, 30, 40, 50 levels, as many levels as you want, really"
487," And so, given that, you can overcome the congestion situation in any city in the world"
488," The challenge is how do you build tunnels quickly and at low cost and with high safety? So, if tunnel technology can be improved to the point where you can build tunnels fast, cheap and safe, then that would completely get rid of any traffic situations in the cities"
489," And, Washington D.C., L.A and most of the major American cities, most major cities in the world suffer from severe traffic issues"
490," And it’s mostly because you’ve got these buildings which are, these tall buildings that are 3-D and you have a road network that is one level"
491," And then, people generally want to go in and out of these buildings at the exact same time"
492,"Well, the most near to impact from a technological standpoint is autonomous cars, like fully self-driving cars"
493, I’d say that’s going to happen much faster than people realize
494," so, and that’s… it’s going to be a great convenience to be in an autonomous car, but there are many people whose job is to drive"
495," So, if… in fact I think it might be the single largest employer of people is driving in various forms"
496, Approaching in fact 2.5 billion cars and trucks in the world
497, The total new vehicle production capacity is about a hundred million
498," Which makes sense, because the life of a car or truck before it’s finally scraped is about 20-25 years"
499," So, so the point at which we see full autonomy appear will not be the point at which there is massive societal upheaval, because it will take a long time to make enough autonomous vehicles to disrupt employment"
500," So, that disruption I’m talking about will take place over about 20 years"
501," Still, 20 years is a short period of time to have I think something like 12 to 15 per cent of the world force be unemployed"
502,"Well, I think the first bit of advice is to really play close attention to… the development of artificial intelligence"
503," I think this is, we need to be just be very careful in… how we adopt artificial intelligence, and to make sure that researchers don’t get carried away, because sometimes what happens is that scientists can get so engrossed in their work, they don’t necessarily realize the ramifications of what they’re doing"
504," So, I think it’s important for public safety that we… you know, governments keep a close eye on artificial intelligence and make sure that it does not represent a danger to the public"
505," Let’s see, secondly, I would say we do need to think about transport in general"
506," And, there’s the movement towards electric vehicles, sustainable transport, I think that’s going to be good for many reasons, but again, not something that happens immediately, that’s going to happen slower than the self-driving vehicles"
507, Because that’s probably something that happens over 30 or 40 years
508," So, currently, in terms of total energy usage in the world, it’s about 1/3, about 1/3 transport, about 1/3 heating"
509," So, over time that will transition to almost all… not all, but predominantly electricity, which means that the demand for electricity will probably triple"
510,"No, well, I think maybe… these things do play into each other a little bit, but what to do about mass unemployment? This is going to be a massive social challenge"
511, And I think ultimately will have to have some kind of universal basic income I don’t think we’re going to have a choice
512,There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better
513," And so, if my assessment is correct and they probably will happen, then we need to say what are we going to do about it"
514, The… So… I think the biggest… I think we’ll just end up doing a universal basic income
515," The harder challenge, much harder challenge, is how do people then have meaning? Like a lot of people, they derive their meaning from their employment, so, if you don’t have… if you’re not needed, if there’s not a need for your labor, how do you… what’s the meaning? Do you have meaning? Do you feel useless? That’s a much harder problem to deal with"
516,"You know, I mean do think that there’s a potential path here which is, I’m really getting into science fiction or sort of advanced science stuff"
517," But, having some sort of merger with biological intelligence, and machine intelligence"
518, Like the fact that as I mentioned earlier you can ask a question and instantly get an answer from Google or from other things
519," I say touchery because you can think of the limbic system, kind of the animal brain or the primal brain and then the cortex, kind of the thinking, planning part of the brain, and then your digital self as a third layer"
520," So, you already have that, and I think if somebody dies, their digital ghost is still around"
521, All of their e-mails and the pictures that they posted and their social media
522," So, over time I think we’ll probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence"
523," And it’s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and your digital… the digital extension of yourself"
524," Particularly output, and, if anything is getting worse, you know, we used to have keyboards that we used a lot, now we do most of our input through our thumbs, on a phone"
525," A computer can communicate at a trillion bits per second, but your thumb can maybe do maybe 10 bits per second or a hundred if you’re being generous"
526," So, some high bandwidth interface to the brain I think will be something that helps achieve symbiosis, between human and machine intelligence and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem"
527," I’m getting pretty esoteric here, I don’t know is this is"
528,"Well, I… I think about what technology solution is necessary in order to achieve that particular goal, and then try to make as much progress in that direction as possible"
529," So, in the case of space flight, the critical breakthrough that’s necessary in space flight, is rapid incomplete reusability of rockets"
530," You can imagine that if an aircraft was a single use, almost no one would fly"
531," Because you can buy like, say, 747 might be… 250 million Dollars, 300 million Dollars, something like that"
532," So, but because you can re-use the aircraft tens of thousands of times, the… Air travel becomes much more affordable"
533," Our rocket costs… 60 million Dollars, roughly"
534," So, a capital cost if it can be used once in 60 million Dollars"
535, But if the capital cost if it can be used a thousand times is 60 thousand Dollars
536," So, then if you can carry a lot of people for a flight, then you can get the cost of space flight to be something not far from the cost of air flight"
537, The difficulty of making a rocket reusable is much greater than the difficulty of making an aircraft reusable
538, That’s why a fully reusable rocket hasn’t been developed that far
539," But if you use the most advanced materials, the most advanced design techniques, and you get everything just right, then I’m confident that you can do a fully reusable rocket"
540," Fortunately, if Earth gravity was even 10 per cent stronger, I would say it wouldn’t be impossible"
541,"Well, I suppose honestly that it tends to be a gut feeling more than anything else"
542," So, when I interview somebody, the main questions are always the same"
543, What do you ask? I say: Tell me the story of your life
544," And, the decisions that you made along the way and why you made them"
545," And then, and also tell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them"
546," And, that question I think is very important, because… the people that really solved the problem, they know exactly how they solved it"
547," But… You know, I think my advice is if you want to make progress in things, I think that the best analytical framework for, I’ll say in the future is physics"
548, I’d recommend studying the thinking process around physics
549," Like, not just the equations, the equations are certainly very helpful, but the way of thinking in physics, it’s the best framework for understanding things that are counter–intuitive"
550," And, you know, always take the position that you are to some degree wrong, and your goal is to be less wrong over time"
551, One of the biggest mistakes people generally make and I’m guilty of it too is wishful thinking
552," And like I said, it’s certainly one that I find myself in, having problems with"
553," But, if you just take that approach of that you’re always to some degree wrong and your goal is to be less wrong"
554,"First of all, my partner is the one that actually mostly came up with the name"
555," I mean it’s just X, the letter X, and then the ae is like pronounced ash"
556," Also, I’ve spent a lot of time on AI and neural nets and so you can sort of see the brain develop, which is … An AI neural net is trying to simulate what a brain does, basically"
557," An analogy that’s often used is like we don’t make a submarine swim like a fish, but we take the principles of hydrodynamics and apply them to the submarine"
558,"I mean, the essential elements of an AI neural net are really very similar to a human brain neural net"
559," It’s having the multiple layers of neurons and you know, back propagation"
560, You have a layer of neurons that goes through a series of intermediate steps to ultimately cognition and then it’ll reverse those steps and go back and forth and go all over the place
561,"Like I said, there are elements that are the same but just like an aircraft does not fly like a bird"
562,"It doesn’t flap its wings, but the wings, the way the wings work and generate lift is the same as a bird"
563,I think possessions kind of weigh you down and they’re kind of an attack vector
564," I mean not everyone, but for sure in recent years billionaire has become pejorative like that’s a bad thing"
565, If you basically organized a company … How does this wealth arise? If you organize people in a better way to produce products and services that are better than what existed before and you have some ownership in that company then that essentially gives you the right to allocate more capital
566," Take Warren Buffet, for example, and to be totally frank I’m not his biggest fan, but you know, he does like have full allocation and he reads a lot of annual reports of companies and all the accounting and it’s pretty boring really"
567, He’s trying to figure out does Coke or Pepsi deserve more capital? I mean it’s kind of a boring job if you ask me
568," Should that company grow or expand? Is it making products and services that are better than others or worse? If a company is making compelling products and services, it should get more capital and if it’s not, it should get less or go out of business"
569," I think it’s really, I do think there, in the United States especially, there’s an over allocation of talent in finance and law"
570," Basically, too many smart people go into finance and law"
571," We should have, I think, fewer people doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff"
572, Manufacturing used to be highly valued in the United States and these days it’s not
573,"You know? Making a car, it’s an honest days living, that’s for sure"
574," Making anything, really, or providing a valuable service like providing good entertainment, good information, these are all valuable things to do"
575," You know, part of it is like I have a bunch of houses, but I don’t spend a lot of time in most of them"
576, Somebody could probably be enjoying those houses and get better use of them me
577,"Yeah, it’ll probably sell for less, but still I don’t care"
578,"I mean, all the cabinets are like handmade and they’re like odd shapes and there’s like doors to nowhere and strange corridors and tunnels and odd paintings on the wall"
579,"Well, I had one house and the Gene Wilder house is right across the road from me from my main house"
580," It was going to get sold and then torn down and turned into, you know, be a big construction zone for three years"
581," I was like, whoa, I think I’ll buy it and preserve the spirit of Gene Wilder and not have a giant construction zone"
582, Then I started having some privacy issues where people would just come to my house and start climbing over the walls and stuff
583,"Then I sort of bought some of the houses around my house and then I thought at one point, well you know, it’d be cool to build a house"
584," I acquired some properties at the top of Somera Road, which has got a great view, and I was like, okay, well there’s a bunch of sort of small older houses, they’re going to get torn down, anyway"
585," I was like, well, if I collect these little houses then I can build something, I don’t know, artistic like a dream house type of thing"
586," You got to have the dome that opens up with the stealth helicopter and that kind of thing, you know?"
587," But then I was like, man, does it really make sense for me to spend time designing and building a house and I’d be real, you know, ghetto like OCD on the little details and the design, or should I be allocating that time to getting us to Mars? I should probably do the latter"
588, Like what’s more important? Mars or a house? I’m like Mars
589,"Well, I think I do have high productivity, but even with that there’s still some opportunity to [inaudible 00:14:57] time and allocating time to building a house, even if it was a really great house, it still is not a good use of time relative to developing the rockets necessary to get us to Mars and helping solve sustainable energy"
590," SpaceX and Tesla are by far, you know, the most amount of brain cycles"
591," The Boring Company does not take, you know, it’s like less than 1% of brain cycles"
592," Then this neural link, which is, I don’t know, maybe it’s like 5% and then …"
593,"No, we’re not testing on people yet, but I think it won’t be too long"
594, I think we may be able to implant a neural link in less than a year in a person I think
595," I mean, you can think of it like people put in heart monitors and things for epileptic seizures and deep brain stimulation obviously like artificial hips and knees and that kind of thing"
596, It’s definitely harder when you’ve got something that is sort of reading and writing neurons that’s generating a current pulse and reading current pulses
597," That’s a little harder than say a passive device, but it’s still very doable"
598, There are people who have primitive devices in their brains right now
599,"Well, like deep brain stimulation, I think for Parkinson’s, has really changed people’s lives in a big way, which is kind of remarkable because it kind of like zaps your brain"
600,"Yeah, so this deep brain stimulation implanted devices in the brain have changed people’s lives for the better like fundamentally"
601," It would be flush with your skull, so you basically take out a chunk of skull, put the Neuralink device in there"
602, You’d insert the electrode threads very carefully into the brain and then you stitch it up and you wouldn’t even know that somebody has it
603," It could be something that helps cure say eyesight, like returns your eyesight even if you’ve lost your optic nerve type of thing"
604," I mean, pretty much anything that it could, in principle, fix almost anything that is wrong with the brain"
605," It could restore limb functionality, so if you’ve got an interface into the motor cortex and then an implant that’s like a microcontroller and near muscle groups, you could then create sort of a neural shunt that restores somebody who is a quadriplegic to full functionality"
606,"Well, yeah, the device we’re working on right now is about, it’s about an inch in diameter"
607,"It might actually, literally, I mean if you’re a big guy, your skull is actually fairly thick"
608," Yeah, yeah, that’s a fair bit of like … We’ve got quite a coconut going on there"
609,"Yeah, and you replace that say one inch diameter piece of skull with the Neuralink device and that has a battery and a Bluetooth and an inductive charger"
610, It’s very carefully putting in the electrodes and avoiding any veins or arteries so it doesn’t create trauma
611,"No, you literally put them where they’re supposed to go"
612,"I mean, they usually go in like, depending on where it is, like two or three millimeters"
613,Then you put the device in and that replaces the little piece of skull that was taken out
614, Then you stitch up the hole and they just look like a little scar and that’s it
615,"Yeah, I mean you could for sure, I mean, basically it’s a generalized sort of thing for fixing any kind of brain injury in principle, or if you’ve got like severe epilepsy or something like that"
616, It could detect it in real time and then fire a counter pulse and stop the epilepsy
617," Like if somebody gets a stroke, they could lose the ability to speak and that could also be fixed"
618, If you’ve got like stroke damage or you lose say muscle control over part of your face or something like that
619," When you get older you tend to, if you’ve got like Alzheimer’s or something like that, then you lose memory and this could help you with restoring your memory and that kind of thing"
620,The thing is it’s like a bunch of circuits and there’s some circuits that are broken and we can fix those circuits
621," When I say we’ve got a shot at probably putting in a person within a year, that’s exactly what I mean"
622, I think we have a chance of putting it into one and having them be healthy and restoring some functionality that they’ve lost
623,"I mean, ultimately if you want to go with full AI symbiosis, you’ll probably want to do something like that"
624,"Yeah, I think this is one of the paths to think like what are … Like AI is getting better and better"
625, Now let’s assume it’s sort of like a benign AI scenario
626," Even in a benign scenario, we’re kind of left behind"
627,"How do you go along for the ride? It’s like you can’t beat them, join them"
628," We’re already a cyborg to some degree, right? Cause you’ve got your phone, you’ve got your laptop"
629,"Today, if you don’t bring your phone along it’s like you have missing limb syndrome"
630," We’re already partly a cyborg or an AI symbiote, essentially it’s just that the data rate to the electronics is slow"
631," I mean like what’s your data rate? Optimistically, a hundred bits per second"
632," This is like, yeah, basically your computer could do things a million times faster"
633," If you can solve the data rate issue and you’re especially output input, too, then you can improve the symbiosis that is already occurring between man and machine"
634,"Exactly, so when you … Like what happens when you, let’s say you’ve got some complex idea that you’re trying to convey to somebody else and how do you do that? Well, your brain spends a lot of effort compressing a complex concept into words and there’s a lot of loss, information loss that occurs when compressing a complex concept into words"
635," Then you say those words and those words are then interpreted, then they’re decompressed by the person who is listening"
636," They will, at best, get a very incomplete understanding of what you’re trying to convey"
637," It’s very difficult to convey a complex concept with precision because you’ve got compression, decompression, you may not even have heard all the words correctly and so communication is difficult"
638,"So, yeah, I think you would, in principle you would be able to communicate very quickly and with far more precision ideas and language would, I’m not sure what would happen to language"
639," You could probably in a situation like this, you would be able to just, it’d be kind of like the matrix"
640,"Well the first few iterations are, what I’m talking about is in the limit over time, with a lot of development"
641, The first few iterations really in the first few versions all we’re going to be trying to do is solve brain injuries
642,If the development continues to accelerate then maybe five years
643,Save your brain state like a saved game in a video game
644," But yeah, I mean you could save state and restore that state into a biological being if you wanted to in the future in principle, nothing from a physics standpoint that prevents us"
645," Now, you’d be a little different, but then you’re also a little different when you wake up in the morning from yesterday and you’re a little different"
646," In fact, if you say like you five years ago versus you today is quite a big difference"
647, There’s no way you could remember a video as accurately as your phone or a camera could
648," So now if you’ve got like some version 10 Neuralink, whatever and far in the future, you could recall everything, just like it’s a movie"
649,This whole thing right now could be a replayed memory
650,There’s no way to assign a probability with accuracy here
651,"Well, I don’t have a Neuralink in my brain, so I’d say right now 0%, but at the point at which you do have a Neuralink, then it rises above 0%"
652," I’m sure, it should be disconcerting because if this is not real, what is? But, there’s that old sort of thought experiment of like, how do you know you’re not a brain in a vent? I mean now here’s the thing"
653,"Everything you see, feel, hear, everything, all your senses are electrical signals, everything"
654, Everything is an electrical signal to a brain in a vent with a vat as our skull
655," Yet, here’s another sort of interesting idea, which is, because you say like where did consciousness arise? Well, assuming you believe the belief in physics, which proves to be true, then the universe started off as basically quarks and leptons and it quickly became hydrogen and helium, lithium, basically elements of the periodic table"
656,8 billion years later that hydrogen became sentient
657, What’s the line of consciousness and not consciousness between hydrogen and here?
658,"Well, I hope consciousness propagates into the future and it gets more sophisticated and complex and that it understands the questions to ask about the universe"
659,"I mean, you don’t always improve, but you can aspire to improve or you can aspire to be less wrong"
660, Just assume you’re wrong and your goal is to be less wrong
661," I don’t think you’re going to succeed every day in being less wrong, but if you’re going to succeed in being less wrong, most of the time you’re doing great"
662,"Yeah, I mean I hope the future is more fun and interesting and we’re just trying to make it that way"
663,"We might lose a little, but hopefully we gain more than lose"
664," I mean you look at civilization through the ages, most of them they rose and fell"
665,"I do think the globalization that we have, sort of like the meme sphere, is there’s not enough isolation between countries or regions"
666," It’s like if you get, if there’s a mind virus that that mind virus can infect too much of the world"
667," I actually sort of sympathize with the anti-globalization people, because it’s like, man, we don’t ever want everywhere to be the same for sure"
668,"No, I’m talking about like somebody, some cockeyed concept that happens right now"
669,"Well, when I’m talking about a mind virus, I’m talking about a concept that infects people’s minds"
670, It’s just wrongheaded idea that goes viral in an idea sense
671,"Well, I mean it’s the kind of thing where your productivity would improve, I don’t know, dramatically, maybe by a factor of 10 with it"
672," So you could definitely just, I don’t know, take out a loan and do it and earn the money back real fast"
673, I mean there are huge differences in cognitive ability and resources already
674, You can think of a corporation as like a cybernetic collective that’s far smarter than an individual
675, I couldn’t personally build a whole rocket and the engines and launch it and everything
676,"But we have 8,000 people at SpaceX and you’re piecing it out to different people and using computers and machines and stuff"
677," We can make lots of rockets launch into orbit, dock with the space station and that kind of thing"
678, So that already exists where those corporations are vastly more capable than an individual
679," But we should be, I think less concerned about relative capabilities between people and more like having AI be vastly beyond us and decoupled from human will"
680," Yeah, like beyond a level that’s difficult to understand and impossible to understand probably"
681," So the way your brain works right now, you’ve got kind of like the animal brain, reptile brain, kind of like the lymphic system basically"
682," Now the brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you’ve got the primitive brain and you’ve got the sort of smart brain or the brain that’s capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey can’t understand"
683,"Now your cortex is much, much smarter than your lymphic system"
684, So I haven’t met anyone who wants to delete their lymphic system or their cortex
685," So you can think of this as being like the computer, the AI is like a third layer, a tertiary layer"
686," It’d be much smarter than the cortex, but you essentially have three layers and you actually have that right now"
687,Your phone is capable of things and your computer is capable of things that your brain is definitely not
688," Storing terabytes of information perfectly, doing incredible calculations that we couldn’t even come close to doing"
689," It’s just like I said, the data rate is slow, the connection is weak"
690,"Yeah, there’s quite a bit of AI going on, artificial neural nets"
691," Increasingly, neural nets are sort of taking over from regular programming more and more"
692," So you are connected, if you use Google Voice or Alexa or one of those things, it’s using a neural net to decode your speech and try understand what you were saying"
693,"If you’re trying to do image recognition or improve the quality of photograph, the neural nets the best way to do that"
694,"No, like I said, if somebody has got a serious brain injury and people that have very severe brain injuries and then you can fix those brain injuries"
695," Then you prove out that it works and [inaudible 00:53:06] expand and make more and more brain injuries, solve more and more"
696, Then moms forget the names of their kids and that kind of thing
697,"It’s like you said, okay, well this would allow you to remember your names of your kids and have a normal, a much more normal life where you were able to function much later in life"
698, So I think essentially almost everyone would find a need at some point if you get old enough to use Neuralink
699," Then it’s like, okay, so we can improve the functionality and improve the communication speed"
700," I don’t know, we probably have to be on version 10 or something before it would realistically be a human AI symbiote situation"
701,"Well, assuming civilization is still around, it’s looking fragile right now"
702," I think we could have, in 25 years probably I would think there could be a whole brain interface"
703,Almost all the neurons are connected to the sort of AI extension of yourself
704,"Well, like I said, you already have a computer extension of yourself and your phone and computers and stuff"
705," So, and now online it’s like somebody dies, there’s like an online ghost that they’re still, their online stuff is still alive"
706,"Instagram and their stories and yeah, whatever Facebook and stuff"
707, I mean this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that is quite shocking
708,"Yeah, I mean I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China before it played out in the US"
709," Yeah, I think the mortality rate is much less than what say the World Health Organization said it was"
710," I mean, you can look at the mortality statistics by age and whether they have comorbidities, like do they have basically existing conditions and by age"
711," If you’re below 60 and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low"
712,Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty
713," I mean, we’re not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite important"
714," It’s sort of elective, but if you don’t get it done in time, you’re going to die"
715,"It’s more like my hip is, I’m in extreme pain because my hip’s blown out or my knee and I don’t want to go to the hospital"
716," People are in extreme pain, people that need a kidney, people that have quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear"
717," At least a factor of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought"
718,"Wash your hands and if you’re coughing, stay at home or wear a mask because it’s not good"
719, If you’re ill you wear a face mask and you don’t cough on people
720, And I think that there’s definitely some silver linings here in improved hygiene and-
721, the system is somewhat moribund with lot of layers of bureaucracy and I think that we’ve cut through some of that bureaucracy
722," but I mean something that’s killing a lot of 20 year olds, let’s say"
723," Like killing large numbers of young healthy people, to find that as like a high mortality than that"
724," And I think there’s this, given it’s just a matter, that there will be eventually some such pandemic"
725," And I think there’s a good chance, it’s highly likely, I think, coming out of this that we will develop vaccines that we didn’t have before for coronaviruses, other viruses, and possibly cures for these"
726, And our understanding of viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that it’s received
727,"So yeah, this is just kind of like a practice run for something that might in the future have a serious, like a really high mortality rate and we kind of got to go through this without it being something that kills vast numbers of young healthy people"
728," I mean, I’ve been in the Twitter war zone for, for a while here, so"
729," It’s like if you’re fighting a war and there’s like some opposing soldier that shoots at you, it’s not like they hate you"
730,"Well, I mean like five minutes every couple of hours type thing"
731,"Yeah, you have to, like I said, take a certain amount of distance from… You read this and be like, “Okay, it’s bullets being fired by an opposing army"
732,"Let’s say you’re just the average citizen trying to just get the facts, figure out what’s going on"
733,"Not trying to push some partisan angle, not trying to not doing sloppy reporting, and just aim it for the most number of clicks and trying to maximize ad dollars and that kind of thing"
734, I think maybe just trying to find individual reporters that you think are good and kind of following them as opposed to publication
735," I mean, in general I think we should be concerned about anything that’s a massive infringement on us"
736, A lot of people died to win independence for the country and fight for the democracy that we have
737, And we should treasure that and not give up our liberties too easily
738," Freedom of assembly and it’s just, I don’t think these things stand up in court, really"
739, These would definitely not stand up if the Supreme court… It’s obviously a complete violation of rights
740," I mean it just should be if you’re at risk, you should not be compelled to leave your house or leave a place of safety, but if you’re not at risk, or if you are at risk and you wish to take a risk with your life, you should have the right to do that"
741," I think there’s a, as I said, my opinion is if somebody wants stay home, they should stay home"
742," If somebody doesn’t want to stay home, they should not be compelled to stay home"
743," If somebody doesn’t like that, well that’s my opinion"
744," This notion though, that you can just sort of send checks out to everybody and things will be fine is not true"
745,Obviously several have this absurd view that the economy is like some magic horn of plenty
746," There’s just a magic horn of plenty and the goods and services, they just come from this magic horn of plenty"
747, And then if somebody has more stuff than somebody else it’s because they took more from this magic horn of plenty
748," So, if you don’t make the food, if you don’t process the food, you don’t transport the food, medical treatment, getting your teeth fixed, there’s no stuff"
749," we’ll run out of the stores, run out of the… the machine just grinds to a halt"
750,"Briefly, but I think if any kind of sensible examination of what happened in China would lead you to conclusion that that is obviously not going to occur"
751," There’s was like, I don’t know, hundred thousand people a day leaving Wuhan"
752," So, it went everywhere very fast throughout China, throughout the rest of the world, and the fatality rate was low"
753,The thing is that American companies have massive supply chains in China
754," Like tier one, two, three, four suppliers throughout China"
755, China is back at full steam and pretty much every US company has some significant number of suppliers in China
756, So you know if they’re able to provide things or not or if there’s high mortality rate
757," But like I said [inaudible 01:25:54] I think there’s the question of where do civil liberties fit in this picture? And what can the government make you do, what can they make you not do, and what’s okay? And I think we went too far"
758," Well, I think we’re rapidly moving towards opening up the country"
759, It’s going to happen extremely fast over the next few weeks
760, Something that would be helpful just to add from an informational level is when reporting Covid cases to separate out diagnosed with Covid versus had Covid like symptoms
761,Because the list of symptoms that could be Covid at this point is like a mile long
762, We’re conflating those two so that it looks bigger than it is
763," Then if somebody dies, was Covid a primary cause of the death or not? I mean, if somebody has Covid, gets eaten by a shark, we find their arm, their arm has Covid, it’s going to get recorded as a Covid death"
764,"If you get hit by a bus, go to the of the hospital and die, and they find that you have Covid, you will be recorded as a Covid death"
765,"Well right now, the road to hell is paved with good intentions"
766," I mean, it’s mostly paved with bad intentions, but there’s some good intentions [inaudible 01:28:37] in there, too"
767," And the stimulus bill that was intended to help with the hospitals that were being overwrought with Covid patients created an incentive to record something as Covid that is difficult to say no to, especially if your hospital’s going bankrupt for lack of other patients"
768," There’s a bunch of hospitals, they’re furloughing doctors, as you were mentioning"
769," If your hospital’s half full, it’s hard to make ends meet"
770," Put them on a ventilator for five minutes, I get $39,000 back"
771," So like I said, somebody should be recorded as Covid only if somebody has been tested"
772," Has has received a positive, positive Covid test"
773," Was Covid a primary reason for death, or did they also have stage three cancer, or heart disease, emphysema, and got hit by bus and had Covid?"
774," And like I said, this is not some sort of a moral [inaudible 01:31:07] of hospital administrators"
775, They actually don’t have enough patients to pay everyone without furloughing doctors and firing staff
776," So then they’re like, “Okay, well the stimulus bill says we get all this money if it’s a Covid death"
777,"” In fact, they’re not even diagnosed with Covid"
778," Frankly, I’m not sure how you die without those things"
779," But to be clear, you don’t even need to have gotten a Covid diagnosis"
780, You simply need to have had one of many symptoms and then have died for some reason and it’s Covid
781," So, then it makes the death count look very high and we’re then stuck in a bind because it looks like the death count’s super high and not going down like it should be"
782," So then, we should keep whatever, keep the shelter in place stuff there, and keep people in their homes, confine people to homes"
783," If you give people, just parse out the data better, clearer information about, like I said, was this an actual COVID diagnosis? Did they get the test and the test came back positive or do they just have some symptoms? Just parse those two out, and then parse out just, if somebody died, did they even have a COVID test or did they just have one of many symptoms"
784,"If you’re going to die, you’re going to have shortness of breath, weakness and you might cough a little"
785,"Yeah, did that person, did they actually have a COVID test and the test come back positive? And then if they died, did they die where COVID was… It doesn’t have to be the main cause, but it was a significant contributor to their death or was it not a significant contributor to the death?"
786,"I mean, people die all the time and they have like flu and other colds and we don’t say that they died of those flu and other colds"
787,"I mean, every year in the world, several hundred thousand people die directly of the flu"
788," I mean, several years ago, or maybe longer, 10 years ago, I helped make a movie called Thank You for Smoking"
789," But until the opioid crisis, I believe Tylenol was the number one killer of all drugs"
790,"Because basically, if you get drunk and take a lot of Tylenol, acetaminophen, essentially it causes liver failure"
791," So people would like get wasted and then have a headache and then pop a ton of Tylenol, its curtains"
792,"I mean I think, you want to look at say deaths as like the, “but for this disease, whatever, they would have lived X number of years"
793,"So, if somebody dies when they’re 20 and could have lived till 80, they lost 60 years"
794, But if somebody dies when they’re 80 and they might’ve lived till 81 they lost one year
795,"So it’s, “How many life years were lost” is probably the right metric to use"
796," I mean actually, I think a lesson to be taken here that I think is quite important is that, if you have your grandparents and that they’re age of grandparents, really be careful with, any kind of flu or cold or something that that is not dangerous to kids or young adults, but is dangerous to the elderly"
797," Basically, if your kid’s got a runny nose, they should stay away from their grandparents, no matter what it is"
798," There’re things where a young immune system has no problem, an older one has a problem"
799," In fact a lot of the deaths are literally, it’s tragic, but they’re, they’re intra-family"
800," It’s, the little kid had a cold or flu and they [crosstalk 01:40:31]"
801," But it’s just important to remember when you get old, your immune system’s just not that strong"
802," As you get older, you tend to put on weight, certainly that’s happening with me"
803," I mean to be totally frank, I mean, speaking for myself, I’d rather read tasty food and live a shorter life"
804," I don’t know what advice to give, maybe having tasty food but smaller amounts of it"
805,"Actually, this may be a useful bit of advice for people, but eating before you go to bed is a real bad idea and actually negatively affects your sleep"
806," And it can actually cause heartburn, that you don’t even know is happening, and that subtle heartburn, it affects your sleep because your horizontal and your body’s digesting"
807," So if you want to improve the quality of your sleep and be healthier, it’s do not eat right before we go to sleep"
808,It’s going to crush your sleep and it’s going to damage your pyloric sphincter and your esophagus
809," Small amounts of alcohol, evidence suggests it doesn’t have a negative effect on-"
810," I mean some of the people who’ve lived the longest, there was a woman in France who I think, maybe has the record or close to it, and she had a glass of wine every day"
811," It’s like, just avoid having alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep, and your quality of sleep will improve and your general health will improve a lot"
812," But yeah, especially if I’m out, say we’re working on Starship or something South Texas and I’m just living in my, I got a little house there in Boca Chica village, and I don’t have much to do, so"
813, Or I’m working and I’ll just lift some weights or something
814," I prefer not to exercise, but if I’m going to exercise, I’ll lift some weights and then kind of run on a treadmill and maybe watch a show, if there’s a compelling show that pulls you in"
815,"Man, don’t watch Black Mirror before going to bed either"
816," It’s like, “Wait, that’s already happened in real life"
817," I did Karate, [foreign language 00:14:51] [crosstalk 01:47:52]"
818," I mean, I kind of got, probably like a lot of people, for the way-early day, the first MMA fights and Royce Gracie, and he was just like incredible"
819, He was winning against people way bigger and that kind of thing
820, I mean Royce got beaten up pretty bad in some of those
821,"My kids… I should say, I sent my kids to jujitsu since they were like, I don’t know, six"
822,"Well I can’t say exactly when, but we got to get it… This COVID thing’s kind of thrown us for a loop"
823,"So, not to blame everything on COVID, but it’s certainly set us back on progress for some number of months"
824," Ahead of Roadster are, ramping up model Y production, that’ll be a great car, it is a great car, getting the Berlin Giga-factory built, and also building Y getting expanding the Shanghai factory, which is going great and get this Cybertruck, Semi truck, Roadster"
825,"Some of the things for Roadster, the tri-motor, plaid powertrain, we’re going to have that in model S"
826," So that’s like part one of the ingredients that’s needed for Roadster, is the plaid powertrain, the more advanced battery pack"
827," You could for sure, lighten the car up and improve tire traction and-"
828,"We just did a software update where it’ll do, like a, cheetah stance"
829," So we’re going to take some things from Cadillac rocket world and put them on a car, so"
830,"When we do the unveil of the Roadster, let me just say that anyone who’s been waiting, they won’t be sorry"
831,"…at least you know that our demos are authentic, because I was not expecting that and then I think I muttered, under my breath, like “Holy shit”"
832,"No, I definitely swore, I didn’t think the micro pick it up but it did"
833," At Tesla, we don’t do like tons of practice for our demos, because we’re working on the cars"
834, We’re building new technologies and improving the fundamental product
835," But, just hours before the demo, both Franz, head of design and I were in the studio throwing steel balls at the window, and it’s bouncing right off"
836,"” Okay? And then, we think what happened was, when Franz hit the door with the sledgehammer-"
837," You can literally wind up with a sledgehammer, full on double-handed sledgehammer and hit the door and there’s not even a dent"
838," But we think that cracked the corner of the glass at the bottom and then, once you crack the corner of the glass it’s game over"
839," It's sort of a hobby company called the Boring Company, which started out as a joke, and we decided to make a real, and dig a tunnel under LA"
840,"And then, we have a merchandise section that only has one piece of merchandise at a time"
841," And in Spaceballs, Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have a flamethrower in the merchandising section of Spaceballs"
842, That's the line when he pulls up the flamethrower
843," Well, we'll sell something for 10 million,"" and that was 20,000 flamethrowers at $500 each"
844," I mean, to be totally frank, it's actually just a roofing torch with an air rifle cover"
845," And, also, we are told that various countries would ban shipping of it, that they would ban flamethrowers"
846," But so far, I've lived in LA for 16 years, and the traffic has always been terrible"
847," And so, I don't see any other, like, ideas for improving the traffic"
848, This is one of the worst places to dig tunnels mostly because of the paperwork
849," You all think it's like, ""What about seismic?"" It's like, actually, both tunnels are very safe in earthquakes"
850," Now, the way the tunnel is constructed, it's constructed out of these interlocking segments, kind of like a snake"
851,"And so, even when the ground moves, the tunnel actually is able to shift along with the ground like an underground snake, and it doesn't crack or break"
852," It's waterproof, methane-proof, well, gas-proof of any kind, and meets all California seismic requirements"
853," And the guy who runs it, like, day-to-day is Steve Davis"
854," So then, we got the permit for the pit, and we dug the pit, and we dug it in, like, I don't know, three days, two to three days"
855," Actually, I think two, 48 hours, something like that because Eric Carr said he was coming by for the Hype"
856," He's like, ""You know, we should dig this pit, and then like show Eric"
857," So, it's about a little over 48 hours later, we dug the pit"
858," And dug this big pit, and we're like, ""Show Eric the pit"
859," But, hey, a hole in the ground is better than no hole in the ground"
860, Like my Wikipedia page says business magnate
861, Can someone please change my Wikipedia page to magnet?
862,"It's structural, mechanical, electrical, software, user interface, engineering, aerospace engineering"
863,"Not bad for a human, but, I think, I will not be able to hold a candle to AI"
864," It's less of a worry than it used to be, mostly due to taking more of a fatalistic attitude"
865," Now, the thing that's going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very tempting to use AI as a weapon"
866," So, the on ramp to serious AI, the danger is going to be more humans using it against each other, I think, most likely"
867,"Well, I mean, you could argue that any group of people, like a company is essentially a cybernetic collective of people and machines"
868," And then, there are different levels of complexity in the way these companies are formed"
869," And then, there's a sort of like a collective AI in the Google, sort of, Search, Google Search, you know, where we're all sort of plugged in as like nodes on the network, like leaves on a big tree"
870," And Google Plus, all the humans that connect to it, are one giant cybernetic collective"
871," This is also true of Facebook, and Twitter, and Instagram, and all the social networks"
872," I mean, I made this comment some years ago, but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for AI"
873, But the AI is informed strangely by the human limbic system
874," It is, in large part, our id writ large"
875,"We mentioned all those things, the sort of primal drives"
876, It's sort of a function of how much limbic resonance they're able to achieve with people
877," But images are just, also, other way of communicating at high bandwidth"
878," What sends, that communicates far more information than you can communicate with your thumb"
879,"If you look at, say, automotive regulations, how long did it take for seatbelts to be implemented, to be required? You know, the auto industry fought seatbelts, I think, for more than a decade"
880, It successfully fought any regulations on seatbelts even though the numbers were extremely obvious
881," If you had seatbelts on, you would be far less likely to die or be seriously injured"
882," Eventually, after many, many people died, regulators insisted on seatbelts"
883," People quote the singularity, and that's probably a good way to think about it"
884," It's hard to predict like a black hole, what happens past the event horizon"
885," So, from a long-term existential standpoint, that's like the purpose of Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can be symbiotic with AI because we have a bandwidth problem"
886," That's, at least, an order of magnitude better than anything else"
887," People may think that the thinking part of themselves is in charge, but it's mostly their limbic system that's in charge"
888," It's launched towards, ""How can I make the limbic system happy?"" That's what it's trying to do"
889,"Now, if we do have a third layer, which is the AI extension of yourself, that is also symbiotic"
890," And there's enough bandwidth between the cortex and the AI extension of yourself, such that the AI doesn't de facto separate"
891," It will enable anyone who wants to have super human cognition, anyone who wants"
892, This is not a matter of earning power because your earning power would be vastly greater after you do it
893," And if that's the case then, and let's say billions of people do it, then the outcome for humanity will be the sum of human will, the sum of billions of people's desire for the future"
894, It's kind of like how much smarter are you with a phone or computer than without? You're vastly smarter actually
895," If you connect to the internet, you can answer any question pretty much instantly, any calculation, that your phone's memory is essentially perfect"
896," Your phone can remember videos, pictures, everything perfectly"
897,And that is like a tiny straw of information flow between your biological self and your digital self
898, It's all the data rate problem that I think we can hang on to human machine symbiosis through the long term
899," And then, people may decide that they want to retain their biological self or not"
900," If your biological self dies, you could probably just upload it to a new unit literally"
901,"I've been thinking about this for a long time, by the way"
902," I think, they didn't quite understand it, or didn't think it was near term, or not sure what to do about it"
903," And I said, like, you know, an obvious thing to do is to just establish a committee, government committee, to gain insight"
904," You know, before you oversight, before you do make regulations, you should like try to understand what's going on"
905," Then, once they learn what's going on, you get up to speed"
906,"Like, I didn't realize chimps did calculated cruelty"
907," I think, one of the issues with social media, it's been pointed out by many people, is that, I think, maybe particularly Instagram people look like they have a much better life than they really do"
908," Even if they're not modifying the pictures, they're, at least, selecting the pictures for the best lighting, the best angle"
909," So, people basically seem they are way better looking than they basically really are"
910," So, if you look at everyone on Instagram, you might think, ""Man, there are all these happy beautiful people, and I'm not that good looking, and I am not happy"
911," And that's going to make you feel sad; when, in fact, those people you think are super happy, actually, not that happy"
912," And you can see to say if you watch some show like Naked and Afraid, or, you know, if you just go and try living in the woods by yourself for a while, and you're like, ""The land that civilization is quite great"
913,""" People want to come back to civilization pretty fast on Naked or Afraid"
914,"Well, the argument for the simulation, I think, is quite strong because if you assume any improvements at all over time, any improvement, 1%, 0"
915,"1%, just extend the time frame, make it a thousand years, a million years"
916," Civilization, if you count it, if you're very generous, civilization is maybe 7000 or 8000 years old if you count it from the first writing"
917,"So, if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will end"
918," Anyway, I don't want to sound like things are too dark because I think like you kind of have to be optimistic about the future"
919," I think, I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right"
920,"The universe, as we know it, will dissipate into a fine mist of cold nothingness eventually"
921," These simulations, we might as well call them reality, or we could call them the multiverse"
922,"Well, when we create a simulation like a game or a movie, it's the distillation of what's interesting about life"
923," And then, that's all to slow down into two or three hours"
924,"So, I think, most likely, if we're a simulation, it's really boring outside the simulation because why would you make simulation as boring? You'd make simulation way more interesting than base reality"
925,"When you're in that virtual reality, which is only going to get better, where are you? Where are you really?"
926,"I mean, I think we should take the actions, the set of actions that are most likely to make the future better"
927," But it seems like the general trend of, like, social awareness seems to be much more heightened now than has ever been in any other time in history because of our ability to express ourselves instantaneously to each other through Facebook, or Twitter, or what have you"
928," And that the trend is to abandon preconceived notions, abandon prejudice, abandon discrimination, and promote kindness and happiness as much as possible"
929,"Well, I mean, in that case there were some engineers at Tesla that said, ""You know, what if we make this car dance and play music?"" I'm like, ""That sounds great"
930,"There's so many things about the Model X, and the Model S, and the Model 3 that people don't know about"
931," We should probably do a video or something to explain it because I have close friends of mine and I say, ""Do you know the car can do this?"" and they're like, ""Nope"
932,"I mean, I think, a Tesla is the most fun thing you could possibly buy ever"
933,You won't be able to drive while you're playing the video game
934," But, like, for example, we're just putting the Atari emulator, RAM emulator in it"
935," So, we'll play a Missile Command, and Lunar Lander, and a bunch of other things"
936," I mean, probe the interface for Missile Command because it's too hard with the old trackball"
937," It's extremely close to mine, but I don't have a front license plate on mine"
938,"We're about to release the software that will enable you to just turn it on, and it'll drive from highway on ramp, to highway exit, do lane changes, overtake other cars-"
939," If you get on, say, the 405, get off 300 miles later, and go through several highway interchanges, and just overtake other cars, and hook into the nav system, and then-"
940," If you don't touch the wheel, it will gradually slow down, and put the emergency lights on, and wake you up"
941,"Imagine if that guy had fallen asleep in a gasoline car, they do all the time"
942,""" A guy was in an early Tesla driving down the highway, and he fell asleep, and he ran over a cyclist, and killed him"
943," I was like, ""Man, if we had autopilot, he might have fallen asleep, but, at least, he wouldn't run over that cyclist"
944,"Well, for lane changes, it's tricky because if you're in like LA, like unless you're pretty aggressive, right, it's hard to change lanes sometimes"
945,"Sometimes, yeah, I think, people like overall are pretty nice on the highway, even in LA, but sometimes they're not"
946, The fundamental issue with roads is that you have a 2D transport system and a 3D living and workspace environment
947," So, you've got all these tall buildings or concentrated work environments"
948," And then, you want to go into those like 2D transport system with-"
949, pretty low density because cars are spaced out pretty far
950," And you can either go 3D up with a flying car, or you can go 3D down with tunnels"
951," You can have as many tunnel levels as you want, and you can arbitrarily relieve any amount of traffic"
952,I wouldn't recommend drilling super far down but the earth is a big-
953,"The earth is a giant ball of lava with a thin crust on the top, which we think of as like the surface, this thin crust"
954," So, the final issue with flying cars, I mean, if you get like one of those like toy drones, think of how loud those are and how much air they blow"
955, Your neighbors are not going to be happy if you land a flying car in your backyard
956," You could have a strong enough magnet, but that magnet would be so strong that you would create a lot of trouble"
957,"I mean, it should have to repel off of either material on the ground or in a really nutty situation off of Earth's gravitational field, and somehow make that incredibly light, but that magnet would cause so much destruction"
958," And then, if you want to go long distances, you can just draw the air out of the tunnel, make sure it's real straight"
959,"If you want to go really fast underground, you would be mag lev in a vacuum tunnel"
960," I mean, they have backup pumps, sort of like, you know, three pumps, or four pumps, or something"
961," Usually, the door doesn't seal quite right on the plane"
962,"Well, I mean, the exciting thing to do would be some sort of electric vertical takeoff and landing, supersonic jet of some kind"
963," And then, the thing that you would use for vertical takeoff and landing is not suitable for high-speed flight"
964,"I guess, thinking about an electric plane is that you want to go as high as possible, but you need a certain energy density in the battery pack because you have to overcome gravitational potential energy"
965," Once you've overcome gravitational potential energy, and you're out at a high altitude, the energy use in cruise is very low"
966," And then, you can recapture a large part of the gravitational potential energy on the way down"
967," So, you really don't need any kind of reserve fuel, if you will, because you have the energy of height, gravitational potential energy"
968," Then, you've got the force of the whatever thrusting device, so the propeller, or turbine, or whatever it is"
969," Air density drops exponentially, but drag increases with the square, and exponential beats the square"
970," And at a certain altitude, you can go supersonic with less energy per mile, quite a lot less energy per mile than an aircraft at 35,000 feet because it's just a force balance"
971,"The airplane, electric airplane isn't necessarily right now"
972, These things are much more important than creating electric supersonic futile
973," That's why electric cars, it matters whether electric cars happen sooner or later"
974," You know, we're really playing a crazy game here with the atmosphere or the oceans"
975,We're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting this in the atmosphere
976," I mean, the bizarre thing is that, obviously, we're going to run out of oil in the long term"
977, We must have a sustainable energy transport and energy infrastructure in the long term
978," So, why run this crazy experiment where we take trillions of tons of carbon from underground and put it in the atmosphere and oceans? This is an insane experiment"
979, We can probably even add some more but the momentum towards sustainable energy is too slow
980,"Like there's a vast base of industry, vast transportation system"
981, Like there's Two and a half billion cars and trucks in the world
982," And the new car and truck production, if it was a 100% electric, that's only about 100 million per year"
983, It makes sense because how long does a car and truck last before it goes into the junkyard and gets crushed? About 20 to 25 years
984,"Well, the thing that is going on right now is that there is an inherent subsidy in any oil-burning device"
985," Any power plant or car is fundamentally consuming the carbon capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, or just the atmosphere for short"
986," So, like, you can say, okay, there's a certain probability of something bad happening past a certain carbon concentration in the atmosphere"
987,"And so, there's some uncertain number where if we put too much carbon into the atmosphere, things overheat, oceans warm up, ice caps melt, ocean real estate becomes a lot less valuable, you know, if something's underwater, but it's not clear what that number is"
988,"I mean, I don't know any serious scientist, actually zero, literally zero who don't think, you know, that we have quite a serious climate risk that we're facing"
989," And so, that's fundamentally a subsidy occurring with every fossil fuel burning thing, power plants, aircraft, car frankly even rockets"
990,"But with cars, there's definitely a better way with electric cars"
991," And to generate the energy, do so with photovoltaics because we've got a giant nuclear reactor in the sky called the sun"
992," So, if you can generate energy from solar panels, store up with batteries, you can have energy 24 hours a day"
993,"And then, you know, you can send to the polls or in the air to the north with, you know, high voltage lines"
994, Most of the northern parts of the world tend to have a lot of hydropower as well
995," But, anyway, all fossil fuel-powered things have an inherent subsidy, which is their consumption of the carbon capacity of the atmosphere and oceans"
996,"So, people tend to think like why should electric vehicles have a subsidy, but they're not taking into account that all fossil fuel-burning vehicles fundamentally are subsidized by the cost, the environmental cost to earth, but nobody's paying for it"
997," You got to make the car compelling, make it better than gasoline or diesel cars"
998," We could totally make one right now that would do 600 miles, but the thing is too expensive"
999,"Well, you know, just have a chartered kilowatt hour battery pack, and you can go 600 miles as long as you're-"
1000,"Well, that would be for Model S, 100-kilowatt hour pack will do about 330 miles"
1001, Maybe 335 because some people have hyper mild it to 500 miles per mile
1002,"Well, the surface area of a car is without making the car look really blocky or having some-"
1003,"Yeah, and just like if it looked a lot of surface area, or like maybe like solar panels fold out, or something-"
1004,"Well, at the beginning of Tesla, I did want to have this like unfolding solar panel thing"
1005," They'd press a button, and it would just like unfold these solar panels, and like charge/recharge your car in the parking lot"
1006, Electric cars have really great traction control because the reaction time is so fast
1007,"Sort of like where you're gassing a car, you've got a lot of latency"
1008," It takes a while for the engine to react, but for electric motors, incredibly precise"
1009," So, it can turn on and off traction within, like, inches of getting on the onus"
1010," Like, let's say, you're driving on a patch of ice, it will turn traction off, and then turn it on a couple inches right after the ice, like a little patch of ice because in the frame of the electric motor, you're moving incredibly slowly"
1011, You're just moving so slowly because it can see at a thousand frames a second
1012,"That S, X, and 3 have the lowest probability of injury of any cars ever tested by the US government"
1013," Like they will be dead in another car, they still sue us"
1014," Let me tell you, most the time, they're very good"
1015,"And like the other guy mentioned who fell asleep in the car, and he rode over a cyclist"
1016,"Yes, he got a lawyer, and he sued us, and the judge was like, ""This is crazy"
1017,"Yes, but for people who think perhaps the justice system consists entirely of judges like that, I want to assure you-"
1018,"And they care about justice, and they could have made a lot more money if they wanted to be a trial lawyer"
1019," And instead, they cared about justice, and they made less money because they care about justice"
1020,And that's not to suggest that we be complacent and assume everyone is honest and ethical
1021," And, obviously, if somebody is given a trusted place in society, such as being a police officer or a judge, and they are corrupt, then we must be extra vigilant against such situations-"
1022," If you're like a district attorney, you know, you tend to sort of see a lot of criminals"
1023,"And I, actually, had this conversation at dinner several years ago with, I guess, it's Tony"
1024," I was like, ""Man, it must, sometimes, seem pretty, pretty dark because, you know, man, there's some terrible human beings out there"
1025,""" And he was like dealing with some case, which consisted of a couple of old ladies that would run people over somehow for insurance money"
1026,""" It's like hard to maintain faith in humanity if you're a district attorney, but, you know, it's only a few percent of society that are actually bad"
1027, Like how bad is the millionth worst person in the United States? Pretty damn bad
1028,"Like the millionth, well, one in a million of evil is so evil, people cannot even conceive of it"
1029," But by the same token, there's also 330 people who are incredible angels and unbelievably good human beings"
1030," It is a very dangerous, but I really think, you know, people should give other people the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are good until proven otherwise"
1031,"I mean, here are these weapons but how many times, like, nobody's presumably try to murder you and you're-"
1032," You know, we got a big test site in Central Texas near Waco"
1033," Actually, you know, they're pretty good at science in China, I have to say"
1034," The mayor of Beijing has, I believe, an environmental engineering degree, and the deputy mayor has a physics degree"
1035," I met them, And Mayor says, ""Shanghai is really smart and-"""
1036,"Well, I think, like, I guess, if you have like top secret stuff, then you want to be pretty careful about what hardware you use"
1037,National spy agencies do not give a rat's ass which porn you watch
1038," So, like, what secrets does a national spy agency have to learn from the average citizen? Nothing"
1039,"I don't think we should worry too much about Huawei phones, you know"
1040," Maybe, you know, a national security agency shouldn't have Huawei phones"
1041, I'm pretty sure the Chinese government does not care about the goings of the average American citizen
1042,Do people want privacy? Because they seem to put everything on the internet
1043,"I think, the things that we think are important now will probably not be important in the future, but there will be things that are important"
1044,"Not that SpaceX because SpaceX is no walk in the park, but a car company, it's very difficult to keep a car company alive"
1045," You know, there's only two companies in the history of American car companies that haven't gone bankrupt, and that's Ford and Tesla"
1046," I mean, 2008 is not a good time to be a car company, especially a startup car company, and especially an electric car company"
1047," By the way, that was a super dumb strategy that we actually did because we-"
1048," One false premise was that we would be able to cheaply convert the Lotus Elise, and use that as a car platform, and that we'll be able to use technology from this little company called AC Propulsion for the electric drive train on the battery"
1049," Premise, the AC propulsion technology did not work in production, and we ended up using none of it in long-term"
1050,"And then once you add a battery pack and electric motor to the car, it got heavier"
1051," Like, I think, it had less than 7% of the parts were common with any other device including cars or anything"
1052," We couldn't use the, like, the HVAC system, the air conditioner"
1053," We need a small highly efficient air conditioning system that fit in a tiny car and was electrically powered, not belt-driven"
1054," The 911, I'm not going to joke, is like the master despite Newton not being on their side"
1055,The problem with something where the engine is mounted over the rear axle or off the rear axle towards the rear is that your polar moment of inertia is fundamentally screwed
1056,"Like, essentially, if you spawn the car like a top, that's your polar moment of inertia"
1057," But, anyway, like the Portia, it's kind of incredible how well Porsche handles given that it's the physics-"
1058," I mean, particularly, the Porsche wouldn't have the variable veins on the turbo, and it didn't have the turbo lag"
1059," The turbo lag is, like, you know, if you flirt, like phone home, call your mom"
1060, The thing is it takes a while to test roof stuff because roofs have to last a long time
1061, And they were trying to make the retrofit panels look real nice
1062," But then, the new product were coming out with it is if you have a roof that's either you're building a house or you're going to replace your roof anyway, then you make the tiles have solar cells embedded in the tiles"
1063,"And then, it's quite a tricky thing because you want to not see the solar cell behind the glass tile"
1064," So, you have to really work with the glass, and the various coatings, and the layers, so that you don't see the solar cells behind the glass"
1065,"5 of the energy that you need, depending on how much roof you have relative to living space"
1066,"Yeah, it should predict when you're going to be home, and then cool the rooms that you're likely to use with a little bit of intelligence"
1067,"But it can tell that you're coming home, it's just going to cool it to the right temperature right when you get there"
1068,But we need to hook it into the air conditioning to really make the air conditioning work
1069," And as you move your wrist, the way it moves from one side to the other, and it winds the watch up"
1070, You create a little charger that's based on wrist movement
1071,It's kind of amazing that you can keep time mechanically on a wristwatch with these tiny little gears
1072," I think, it'd be sort of like, you know, there was a time of transition where there were horses and gasoline cars on the road at the same time"
1073,"000 horses, then figure out like if a horse lives 15 years, you got 20,000 horses dropping dead every day or every year, I should say"
1074,They'll probably get pretty freaked out if they have to move our dead horse
1075,"Like, in my mind, dragging this dead, you know, horse around, and I'm a horse"
1076,"It might sound great if it's turned on, but what if it doesn't turn off?"
1077," I'm getting text messages from a friend saying, ""What the hell are you doing smoking weed?"""
1078,"You know, I know a lot of people like weed, and that's fine, but I don't find that it is very good for productivity"
1079,I don't know what would happen if I got into a sensory deprivation tank
1080,"I mean, just sort of sit there, and be quiet, and then repeat some mantra, which acts as a focal point"
1081," It does still the mind, but I don't find myself drawn to it frequently"
1082,"I think, when I was, I don't know, five or six or something"
1083,I hope they wouldn't find out because they might like put me away or something
1084," I mean, but, like, you know, my goal is like try to do useful things, try to maximize the probability for the future's good, make the future exciting, something you look forward to, you know"
1085," Like, how do you think you could buy that you really love, that really give you joy? So rare, so rare"
1086," Like what are the set of things that can be done to make the future better? Like, you know, like so, I think, a future where we are a space-faring civilization and out there among the stars"
1087," You know, the things, there need to be things that make you look forward to waking up in the morning"
1088,"You wake up in the morning, you look forward to the day, you look forward to the future"
1089," And a future where we are a space-faring civilization and out there among the stars, I think, that's very exciting"
1090," That is a thing we want; whereas, if we knew we would not be a space-faring civilization but forever confined to Earth, this would not be a good future"
1091,"Well, it's probably, if you're saying when does the sun boil the oceans-"
1092," I just think like if there are two futures, and one future us we're out there among the stars, and the things we read about and see in science fiction movies, the good ones are true, and we have these starships, and we're going see what other planets are like, and we're a multi-planet species, and the scope and scale of consciousness is expanded across many civilizations, and many planets, and many star systems, this is a great future"
1093,"No, but probably spend more time with your friends and less time on social media"
1094,"Yeah, I mean, the only thing I've kept is Twitter because I kind of like meet some means of getting a message out, you know"
1095,"I mean, the vast number of negative comments, for the vast majority, I just ignore them, the vast majority"
1096,"Every now and again, you have draw in, something not good"
1097, I'm not sure why people think that anyone would think that deleting a tweet makes them go away
1098,"Like high school, ""We'll put this on your permanent record"
1099," I mean, it's way easier to be mean on social media than it is to be mean in person"
1100," I think, you know, I think people should be nicer to each other, and give more credit to others, and don't assume that they're mean until you know they're actually mean"
