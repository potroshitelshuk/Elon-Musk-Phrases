0,I’d like to thank you for leaving ‘crazy person’ out of the description
1,"So, I thought — I was trying to think what’s the most useful thing that I – what I can  say that can actually be helpful and useful to you in the future"
2,"And I thought, perhaps tell the story of how I sort of came to be here"
3,How did these things happen?  And maybe there are lessons there
4,"I often find myself wondering, how did this happen"
5,"When I was young, I didn’t really know what I was going to do when I got older"
6,People kept asking me
7,"But then eventually, I thought the idea of inventing things would be really cool"
8,And the reason I thought that was because I read a quote from Arthur C. Clark which  said that “A sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.’  And that’s really true
9,"If you go back say, 300 years, the things we take for granted today, you’d be burned  at stake for"
10,Being able to fly
11,"Being able to see over long distances, being able to communicate, having effectively with  the Internet as a group mind of sorts, and having access to all the world’s information  instantly from almost anywhere on the earth"
12,This stuff that really would be magic – that would be considered magic in times past
13,"In fact, I think it actually goes beyond that, because there are many things that we take  for granted today that weren’t even imagined in times past, that weren’t even in the  realm of magic"
14,"So, it actually goes beyond that"
15,"So I thought, well if I can do some of those things – basically if I can advance technology,  then that is like magic and that would be really cool"
16,"I always had an existential crisis, because I was trying to figure out ‘what does it  all mean?’  Like what’s the purpose of things?  And I came to the conclusion that if we can advance the knowledge of the world, if we  can do things that expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we’re better able  to ask the right questions and become more enlightened"
17,And that’s the only way forward
18,"So, I studied physics and business, because I figured in order to do a lot of these things  you need to know how the universe works and you need to know how the economy works"
19,And you also need to be able to bring a lot of people together to work with you to create  something
20,Because it’s very difficult to do something as individuals if it’s a significant technology
21,"So, I originally came out to California to try to figure out how to improve the energy  density of electric vehicles – basically to try to figure out if there was an advanced  capacitor that could serve as an alternative to batteries"
22,And that was in 1995
23,That’s also when the Internet started to happen
24,"And I thought well I could either pursue this technology, where success may not be one of  the possible outcomes, which is always tricky, or participate in the Internet and be part  of it"
25,"So, I decided to drop out"
26,"Fortunately, we’re past graduation, so, I can’t be accused of recommending that  to you"
27,"And I did some Internet stuff, you know"
28,I’ve done a few things here and there
29,One of which is PayPal
30,"Maybe it’s helpful to say, one of the things that was important then in the creation of  PayPal was how it started"
31,"Because initially – the initial thought with PayPal was to create a conglomeration  of financial services, so if you have one place where all of your financial services  needs could be seamlessly integrated and works smoothly"
32,"And we had a little feature, which was through e-mail payments"
33,"Whenever we’d show the system off to someone, we’d show the hard part, which was the conglomeration  of financial services, which is quite difficult to put together"
34,"Then we showed people e-mail payments, which was quite easy, and everybody was interested"
35,"So, I think it’s important to take feedback from your environment"
36,You want to be as closed-loop as possible
37,"So, we focused on e-mail payments and tried to make that work"
38,And that’s what really got things to take off
39,"But, if we hadn’t responded to what people said, then we probably would not have been  successful"
40,"So, it’s important to look for things like that and focus on them when you seem them,  and you correct your prior assumptions"
41,"Going from PayPal, I thought well, what are some of the other problems that are likely  to most affect the future of humanity?  It really wasn’t from the perspective of, ‘what’s the best way to make money,’  which is okay, but it was really ‘what do I think is going to most affect the future  of humanity.’  So, the biggest terrestrial problem we’ve got is sustainable energy"
42,But the production and consumption of energy in a sustainable manner
43,"If we don’t solve that in this century, we’re in deep trouble"
44,And the other one being the extension of life beyond earth to make life multi-planetary
45,So that’s the basis for — the latter is the basis for SpaceX and the former is the  basis for Tesla and SolarCity
46,"When I started SpaceX, initially, I thought that well, there’s no way one could start  a rocket company"
47,I wasn’t that crazy
48,"But then, I thought, well, what is a way to increase NASA’s budget?  That was actually my initial goal"
49,"I thought well if we could do a low-cost mission to Mars, something called Mars Oasis, which  would land with seeds in dehydrated nutrient gel, then hydrate them upon landing"
50,And you’d have this great short of money shot of green plants on a red background
51,The public tends to respond to precedence and superlatives
52,And this would be the first life on Mars and the furthest life had ever traveled as far  as we know
53,And I thought well that would get people really excited and increase NASA’s budget
54,So obviously the financial outcome from such a mission would probably be zero
55,"So, anything better than that was on the upside"
56,"So, I went to Russia three times to look at buying a refurbished ICBM… because that  was the best deal"
57,"And I can tell you it was very weird going there in late 2001-2002 going to the Russian  rocket forces and saying, ‘I’d like to buy two of your biggest rockets, but you can  keep the nuke.’  That’s a lot more"
58,"That was 10 years ago, I guess"
59,"They thought I was crazy, but I did have money"
60,"So, that was okay"
61,"After making several trips to Russia, I came to the conclusion that… that actually my  initial impression was wrong about – because my initial thought was, well, that there is  not enough will to explore and expand beyond earth and have a Mars base, that kind of thing"
62,But I came to the conclusion that was wrong
63,"In fact, there’s plenty of will, particularly in the United States"
64,"Because United States is a nation of explorers, so people who came here from other parts of  the world"
65,I think the United States is really a distillation of the spirit of human exploration
66,"But if people think it’s impossible, then well it’s going to completely break the  federal budget, then they’re not going to do it"
67,"So, after my third trip, I said, okay, what we really need to do here is try to solve  the space transport problem and started SpaceX"
68,And this was against the advice of pretty much everyone I talked to
69,One friend made sit down and watch a bunch of videos of rockets blowing up
70,Let me tell you he wasn’t far wrong
71,It was tough going there in the beginning
72,Because I never built anything physical
73,I mean I built like a model rocket as a kid and that kind of thing
74,But I never had a company that built any physical
75,"So, I had to figure out how to do all these things and bring together the right team of  people"
76,"And we did all that, and then, failed three times"
77,"It was tough, tough going"
78,"Because the thing about a rocket is, the passing grade is 100%"
79,And you don’t get to actually test the rocket in the real environment that is going to be  in
80,"So, I think to the best analogy for rocket engineers is, if you want to create a really  complicated beta software, you can’t run the software as an integrated whole, and you  can’t run it on the computer, it’s intended to run on"
81,"For the first time you put it all together and run it on that computer, it must run with  no bugs"
82,That’s basically the essence of it
83,"So, we missed the mark there"
84,"Think about a rocket, the passing grade is 100%"
85,And you don’t get to actually test the rocket in the real environment that is going to be  in
86,"So, I think the best analogy for rocket engineers is, if you want to create a really complicated  software, you can’t run the software as an integrated whole, and you can’t run it  on the computer, it’s intended to run on, but the first time you run it on the computer,  it must run with no bugs"
87,That’s basically the essence of it
88,"So, we missed the mark there"
89,"The first launch, I was picking up bits of rocket near the launch site, it was a bit  sad"
90,And we learned with each successive flight
91,"And we were able to, eventually with the fourth flight in 2008, reach orbit"
92,That was also with the last bit of money that we had
93,Thank goodness that happened
94,"I think the saying is ‘fourth time is the charm?’  So, we got the Falcon 1 to orbit"
95,"And then, began to scale it up to the Falcon 9 which is about an order of magnitude more  thrust, it’s around a million pounds of thrust"
96,"We managed to get that to orbit, and then developed the Dragon spacecraft, which recently  was able to dock and returned to earth from the space station"
97,That   was a white-knuckle event
98,It is a huge relief
99,I still can’t believe it actually happened
100,But there’s lot more that must happen beyond this in order for humanity to become a spacefaring  civilization and ultimately a multi-planet species
101,And that’s something I think it’s vitally important
102,And I hope that some of you will participate in that either at SpaceX or other companies
103,Because it’s just really one of the most important things for the preservation and  extension of consciousness
104,"It’s worth noting as I’m sure people are aware that Earth has been around for 4 billion  years, but civilization in terms of having writing has been about 10,000 years, and that’s  being generous"
105,"So, it’s really somewhat of a tenuous existence that civilization and consciousness has been  on earth"
106,I’m actually fairly optimistic about the future of earth
107,I don’t want to people sort of have the wrong impression like we’re all about to  die
108,I think things will most likely be okay for a long time on earth
109,"Not for sure, but, most likely"
110,"But even if it’s 99% likely, a 1% chance is still worth spending a fair bit of effort  to ensure that we have — back up the biosphere, and planetary redundancy if you will"
111,And I think it’s really quite important
112,"And in order to do that, there’s breakthrough that needs to occur which is to create a rapidly  and completely reusable transport system to Mars, which is one of those things that’s  right on the borderline of even impossible"
113,But that’s the sort of the thing that we’re going to try to achieve with SpaceX
114,"And then, on the Tesla front, the goal with Tesla was really to try to show what electric  cars can do"
115,"Because people had the wrong impression, and we had to change people’s perceptions of  electric vehicle"
116,"Because they used to think of it as something that was slow and ugly, with low range, like  a golf cart"
117,"So, that’s why we created the Tesla Roadster, to show that it can be fast, attractive and  long range"
118,"And it’s amazing how — even though you can show that something works on paper, and  the calculations are very clear, until you actually have the physical object, and they  can drive it, it doesn’t really sink in for people"
119,So that I think is something worth nothing
120,"If you’re going to create a company, the first thing you should try to do is create  a working prototype"
121,Everything looks great on PowerPoint
122,You can make anything work on PowerPoint
123,"But, if you have an actual demonstration article, even if it’s in primitive form, that’s  much more effective in convincing people"
124,"So, we made the Tesla Roadster, and now we’re coming out soon with model S, which is a 4-door  sedan"
125,"Because after we made the Tesla Roadster people said, ‘oh sure, sure we always knew you  could make a car like that, it’s an expensive car and it’s low volume and small and all  that but can you make a real car?’  Okay, fine, we’re going to make that, too"
126,"So, that’s coming out soon"
127,"And so that’s where things are and hopefully, there are lessons to be drawn there"
128,I think the overreaching point I want to make is that: You guys are the magicians of the  21st century
129,Don’t let anything hold you back
130,Imagination is the limit
131,Go out there and create some magic
132," Well, it goes back to when I was in university"
133," I thought about, what are the problems that are most likely to affect the future of the world or the future of humanity? I think it's extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production"
134," That sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century, independent of environmental concerns"
135," In fact, even if producing CO2 was good for the environment, given that we're going to run out of hydrocarbons, we need to find some sustainable means of operating"
136, There's two elements to that answer
137," One is that, even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars, you're still better off"
138," So if you take, say, natural gas, which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel, if you burn that in a modern General Electric natural gas turbine, you'll get about 60 percent efficiency"
139," If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car, you get about 20 percent efficiency"
140," And the reason is, in the stationary power plant, you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more, is voluminous, and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source"
141," So in effect, even after you've taken transmission loss into account and everything, even using the same source fuel, you're at least twice as better off charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant"
142," Yes, it does"
143," And then the other point is, we have to have sustainable means of power generation anyway, electricity generation"
144," So given that we have to solve sustainable electricity generation, then it makes sense for us to have electric cars as the mode of transport"
145," So, in order to accelerate the advent of electric transport, and I should say that I think, actually, all modes of transport will become fully electric with the ironic exception of rockets"
146, There's just no way around Newton's third law
147," The question is how do you accelerate the advent of electric transport? And in order to do that for cars, you have to come up with a really energy efficient car, so that means making it incredibly light, and so what you're seeing here is the only all-aluminum body and chassis car made in North America"
148," In fact, we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack"
149, And then it also has the lowest drag coefficient of any car of its size
150," So as a result, the energy usage is very low, and it has the most advanced battery pack, and that's what gives it the range that's competitive, so you can actually have on the order of a 250-mile range"
151," The rest of the car has to be very light to offset the mass of the pack, and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range"
152," And in fact, customers of the Model S are sort of competing with each other to try to get the highest possible range"
153, I think somebody recently got 420 miles out of a single charge
154," In creating an electric car, the responsiveness of the car is really incredible"
155," So we wanted really to have people feel as though they've almost got to mind meld with the car, so you just feel like you and the car are kind of one, and as you corner and accelerate, it just happens, like the car has ESP"
156, You can do that with an electric car because of its responsiveness
157, You can't do that with a gasoline car
158," I think that's really a profound difference, and people only experience that when they have a test drive"
159," The goal of Tesla has always been to have a sort of three-step process, where version one was an expensive car at low volume, version two is medium priced and medium volume, and then version three would be low price, high volume"
160, So we're at step two at this point
161," So we had a $100,000 sports car, which was the Roadster"
162," Then we've got the Model S, which starts at around 50,000 dollars"
163," And our third generation car, which should hopefully be out in about three or four years will be a $30,000 car"
164," But whenever you've got really new technology, it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass-market product"
165," And so I think we're making progress in that direction, and I feel confident that we'll get there"
166," There actually are far more charging stations than people realize, and at Tesla we developed something called a Supercharging technology, and we're offering that if you buy a Model S for free, forever"
167, And so this is something that maybe a lot of people don't realize
168," We actually have California and Nevada covered, and we've got the Eastern seaboard from Boston to D.C"
169," By the end of this year, you'll be able to drive from L.A"
170," to New York just using the Supercharger network, which charges at five times the rate of anything else"
171," And the key thing is to have a ratio of drive to stop, to stop time, of about six or seven"
172," So if you drive for three hours, you want to stop for 20 or 30 minutes, because that's normally what people will stop for"
173," So if you start a trip at 9 a.m., by noon you want to stop to have a bite to eat, hit the restroom, coffee, and keep going"
174," Actually, what we're expecting is for people to stop for about 20 to 30 minutes, not for an hour"
175," It's actually better to drive for about maybe 160, 170 miles and then stop for half an hour and then keep going"
176, That's the natural cadence of a trip
177," Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have to have sustainable electricity production as well as consumption, so I'm quite confident that the primary means of power generation will be solar"
178," I mean, it's really indirect fusion, is what it is"
179," We've got this giant fusion generator in the sky called the sun, and we just need to tap a little bit of that energy for purposes of human civilization"
180, What most people know but don't realize they know is that the world is almost entirely solar-powered already
181," If the sun wasn't there, we'd be a frozen ice ball at three degrees Kelvin, and the sun powers the entire system of precipitation"
182, The whole ecosystem is solar-powered
183," Well actually, I'm confident that solar will beat everything, hands down, including natural gas"
184," It must, actually"
185," If it doesn't, we're in deep trouble"
186," No, we actually are"
187, You can buy a solar system or you can lease a solar system
188, Most people choose to lease
189," And the thing about solar power is that it doesn't have any feed stock or operational costs, so once it's installed, it's just there"
190, It works for decades
191, It'll work for probably a century
192," And we've made huge progress in that direction, and that's why I'm confident we'll actually beat natural gas"
193," Typical leases are 20 years, but the value proposition is, as you're sort of alluding to, quite straightforward"
194," It's no money down, and your utility bill decreases"
195, Pretty good deal
196," Well, essentially, SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say, a company or a bank"
197, Google is one of our big partners here
198, And they have an expected return on that capital
199," With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill"
200, What it amounts to is a giant distributed utility
201," I think it's a good thing, because utilities have been this monopoly, and people haven't had any choice"
202," So effectively it's the first time there's been competition for this monopoly, because the utilities have been the only ones that owned those power distribution lines, but now it's on your roof"
203, So I think it's actually very empowering for homeowners and businesses
204," I'm extremely confident that solar will be at least a plurality of power, and most likely a majority, and I predict it will be a plurality in less than 20 years"
205, I made that bet with someone 
206, More from solar than any other source
207, With a friend who will remain nameless
208," I made that bet, I think, two or three years ago, so in roughly 18 years, I think we'll see more power from solar than any other source"
209," I got that question a lot, that's true"
210," People would say, ""Did you hear the joke about the guy who made a small fortune in the space industry?"" Obviously, ""He started with a large one,"" is the punchline"
211," And so I tell people, well, I was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one"
212," And they'd look at me, like, ""Is he serious?"""
213, It was a close call
214, Things almost didn't work out
215," We came very close to failure, but we managed to get through that point in 2008"
216," The goal of SpaceX is to try to advance rocket technology, and in particular to try to crack a problem that I think is vital for humanity to become a space-faring civilization, which is to have a rapidly and fully reusable rocket"
217," I did build rockets when I was a kid, but I didn't think I'd be involved in this"
218," It was really more from the standpoint of what are the things that need to happen in order for the future to be an exciting and inspiring one? And I really think there's a fundamental difference, if you sort of look into the future, between a humanity that is a space-faring civilization, that's out there exploring the stars, on multiple planets, and I think that's really exciting, compared with one where we are forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event"
219," Well, we've made significant advances in the technology of the airframe, the engines, the electronics and the launch operation"
220," No, we don't patent"
221," Since our primary competitors are national governments, the enforceability of patents is questionable"
222," Right, so the big innovation—"
223, So the thing about rockets is that they're all expendable
224, All rockets that fly today are fully expendable
225," The space shuttle was an attempt at a reusable rocket, but even the main tank of the space shuttle was thrown away every time, and the parts that were reusable took a 10,000-person group nine months to refurbish for flight"
226, So the space shuttle ended up costing a billion dollars per flight
227, Obviously that doesn't work very well for —
228," So it's important that the rocket stages be able to come back, to be able to return to the launch site and be ready to launch again within a matter of hours"
229,"  And so what a lot of people don't realize is, the cost of the fuel, of the propellant, is very small"
230, It's much like on a jet
231, So the cost of the propellant is about .3 percent of the cost of the rocket
232," So it's possible to achieve, let's say, roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket"
233, That's why it's so important
234," Every mode of transport that we use, whether it's planes, trains, automobiles, bikes, horses, is reusable, but not rockets"
235, So we must solve this problem in order to become a space-faring civilization
236, Certain cruises are apparently highly problematic
237," We're actually, we've been making some good progress recently with something we call the Grasshopper Test Project, where we're testing the vertical landing portion of the flight, the sort of terminal portion which is quite tricky"
238, And we've had some good tests
239, So that's just to give a sense of scale
240, We dressed a cowboy as Johnny Cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket
241," Yeah, so that rocket is about the size of a 12-story building"
242," (Rocket launch) So now it's hovering at about 40 meters, and it's constantly adjusting the angle, the pitch and yaw of the main engine, and maintaining roll with cold gas thrusters"
243," I don't know, actually"
244, I don't have a good answer for you
245, I work a lot
246," I mean, a lot"
247," Well, I do think there's a good framework for thinking"
248, It is physics
249," You know, the sort of first principles reasoning"
250," Through most of our life, we get through life by reasoning by analogy, which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations"
251, And you have to do that
252," Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day"
253," But when you want to do something new, you have to apply the physics approach"
254," Physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive, like quantum mechanics"
255, It's really counterintuitive
256," So I think that's an important thing to do, and then also to really pay attention to negative feedback, and solicit it, particularly from friends"
257," This may sound like simple advice, but hardly anyone does that, and it's incredibly helpful"
258, Thanks for having me
259, I ask myself that frequently
260," We're trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefullybe a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion"
261," So right now, one of the mostsoul-destroying things is traffic"
262, It affects peoplein every part of the world
263, It takes away so much of your life
264, It's particularly horrible in LA
265, So a couple of key thingsthat are important in having a 3D tunnel network
266," First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entranceand exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city"
267," So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate,that's on an elevator, you can integrate the entranceand exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces"
268, And then the car gets on a skate
269," There's no speed limit here, so we're designing this to be ableto operate at 200 kilometers an hour"
270," 200 kilometers an hour,or about 130 miles per hour"
271," So, I don't knowif people noticed it in the video, but there's no real limitto how many levels of tunnel you can have"
272, You can go much further deepthan you can go up
273," The deepest mines are much deeperthan the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrarylevel of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network"
274, This is a very important point
275," So a key rebuttal to the tunnelsis that if you add one layer of tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion,it will get used up, and then you'll be back where you started,back with congestion"
276," But you can go to anyarbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels"
277," Well, they're right"
278, So it's roughly a billion dollars a mileto do the subway extension in LA
279, And this is not the highestutility subway in the world
280," So yeah, it's quite difficultto dig tunnels normally"
281, I think we need to haveat least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling
282," Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximatelyan order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that"
283, So the first thing to dois to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more
284," So a single road lane tunnelaccording to regulations has to be 26 feet,maybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashesand emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilationfor combustion engine cars"
285," But if you shrink that diameterto what we're attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plentyto get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional areaby a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scaleswith the cross-sectional area"
286, So that's roughly a half-orderof magnitude improvement right there
287," Then tunneling machines currently tunnelfor half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the timeis putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall"
288," So if you design the machine instead to do continuoustunneling and reinforcing, that will give youa factor of two improvement"
289, Combine that and that's a factor of eight
290," Also these machines are far from beingat their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the powerto the machine substantially"
291," I think you can getat least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or fiveimprovement on top of that"
292, We want to beat Gary
293,"  He's not a patient little fellow, and that will be victory"
294, Victory is beating the snail
295, I'm in favor of flying things
296," Obviously, I do rockets,so I like things that fly"
297," This is not some inherent biasagainst flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they'll be quite noisy, the wind force generatedwill be very high"
298," Let's just say that if something'sflying over your head, a whole bunch of flying carsgoing all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation"
299,"  You don't think to yourself,""Well, I feel better about today."" You're thinking,""Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come offand guillotine me?"" Things like that"
300," Yeah, so we've beensort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while"
301," We built a Hyperloop test trackadjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovativeideas in transport"
302," And it actually ends up beingthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume"
303, So we're cautiously optimistic we'll be able to be fasterthan the world's fastest bullet train even in a .8-mile stretch
304, It's either going to smashinto tiny pieces or go quite fast
305," So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or near-vacuum"
306," So actually, it sort of turns outthat automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enoughto resist the water table, it is automaticallycapable of holding vacuum"
307, I think there's no real length limit
308, You could dig as much as you want
309," I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop, I think you'd probably wantto go underground the entire way because it's a high-density area"
310," You're going undera lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel"
311," Sometimes people think,well, it's going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house"
312," Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or fourtunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be ableto detect it being dug at all"
313," In fact, if you're ableto detect the tunnel being dug, whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of moneyfor that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detecttunnels from Hamas, and from the US Customs and Border patrolthat try and detect drug tunnels"
314," So the reality is that earth is incredibly goodat absorbing vibrations, and once the tunnel depthis below a certain level, it is undetectable"
315," Maybe if you have a very sensitiveseismic instrument, you might be able to detect it"
316, What's funny about that? 
317, It's maybe ..
318, two or three percent
319, We bought some second-hand machinery
320," A lot of people thinkthat when you make cars autonomous, they'll be able to go fasterand that will alleviate congestion"
321," And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomywhere it's much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a carwill be better than that of a bus"
322," Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket"
323," So the amount of driving that will occurwill be much greater with shared autonomy, and actually traffic will get far worse"
324,  I don't know
325, I don't know
326, I think almost every automakerhas some electric vehicle program
327, They vary in seriousness
328," Some are very seriousabout transitioning entirely to electric, and some are just dabbling in it"
329," And some, amazingly,are still pursuing fuel cells, but I think that won't last much longer"
330," I intend to stay with Teslaas far into the future as I can imagine, and there are a lot of excitingthings that we have coming"
331, Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon
332, We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck
333," Yeah, it's looking quite goodfor starting production in July"
334," Yeah, so this is usingonly cameras and GPS"
335, So there's no LIDARor radar being used here
336," This is just using passive optical,which is essentially what a person uses"
337," The whole road systemis meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras, and so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved"
338," If you don't solve vision,it's not solved"
339, So that's why our focus isso heavily on having a vision neural net that's very effective for road conditions
340, You can absolutelybe superhuman with just cameras
341," Like, you can probably do itten times better than humans would, just cameras"
342," I think we're still on trackfor being able to go cross-country from LA to New York by the endof the year, fully autonomous"
343," Essentially,November or December of this year, we should be able to go all the wayfrom a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any pointduring the entire journey"
344," Yes, but the thingthat will be interesting is that I'm actually fairly confidentit will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically"
345, So it's not sort of limitedto LA to New York
346," We could change itand make it Seattle-Florida, that day, in real time"
347, So you were going from LA to New York
348, Now go from LA to Toronto
349, I think that's about two years
350," So the real trick of itis not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent of the time, because, like, if a car crashesone in a thousand times, then you're probably still not goingto be comfortable falling asleep"
351," You shouldn't be, certainly"
352,  It's never going to be perfect
353," Well, I think that the autonomy systemis likely to at least mitigate the crash, except in rare circumstances"
354, The thing to appreciateabout vehicle safety is this is probabilistic
355," I mean, there's some chance that any timea human driver gets in a car, that they will have an accidentthat is their fault"
356, It's never zero
357, So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomyneed to be than a person before you can rely on it?
358, Absolutelythis is what will happen
359," So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can chooseto use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be usedonly by friends and family, only by other driverswho are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimesbut not other times"
360, That's 100 percent what will occur
361, It's just a question of when
362, I will show youa teaser shot of the truck
363,  It's alive
364, That's definitely a casewhere we want to be cautious about the autonomy features
365," So this is a heavy duty,long-range semitruck"
366, So it's the highest weight capability and with long range
367, So essentially it's meant to alleviatethe heavy-duty trucking loads
368, And this is something whichpeople do not today think is possible
369," They think the truck doesn't have enoughpower or it doesn't have enough range, and then with the Tesla Semi we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi"
370," And if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla Semiwill tug the diesel semi uphill"
371," So what will bereally fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curvewith an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kindof internal combustion engine car, you've got a torque RPM curvethat looks like a hill"
372, So this will be a very spry truck
373, You can drive thisaround like a sports car
374," There's no gears.It's, like, single speed"
375, It's quite bizarre test-driving
376, When I was driving the test prototypefor the first truck
377," It's really weird,because you're driving around and you're just so nimble,and you're in this giant truck"
378," Yeah, I drove itaround the parking lot, and I was like, this is crazy"
379," It's just like,driving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers"
380," Well, this illustratesthe picture of the future that I think is how things will evolve"
381, You've got an electric carin the driveway
382," If you look in betweenthe electric car and the house, there are actually three Powerwallsstacked up against the side of the house, and then that house roof is a solar roof"
383, So that's an actual solar glass roof
384, That's a real fake house
385," Solar glass tiles where you can adjustthe texture and the color to a very fine-grained level, and then there'ssort of microlouvers in the glass, such that when you're lookingat the roof from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cellbehind it or not"
386, So you have an even color from the ground level
387," If you were to look at itfrom a helicopter, you would be actually ableto look through and see that some of the glass tiles havea solar cell behind them and some do not"
388, You can't tell from street level
389," Well after the house has collapsed and there's nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there"
390," Yeah, we're starting offwith two, two initially, and the second twowill be introduced early next year"
391, I think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof
392, The thing is to considerthe time scale here to be probably on the order of 40 or 50 years
393," So on average, a roofis replaced every 20 to 25 years"
394, But you don't start replacingall roofs immediately
395," But eventually,if you say were to fast-forward to say 15 years from now, it will be unusual to have a roofthat does not have solar"
396," It depends on where you are and what the house size isrelative to the roof area, but it's a fair statement to say that most houses in the UShave enough roof area to power all the needs of the house"
397," Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory, progress so far on the Gigafactory"
398," Eventually, you can sort of roughly see that there's sort ofa diamond shape overall, and when it's fully done,it'll look like a giant diamond, or that's the idea behind it, and it's aligned on true north"
399, It's a small detail
400," A hundred gigawatt hours.We think probably more, but yeah"
401, They're in production already
402, That's the slowed down version
403," Well, when it's running at full speed, you can't actually see the cellswithout a strobe light"
404, It's just blur
405," It's about a hundred, roughly"
406," It's not 10, it's not a thousand"
407, Most likely a hundred
408, I think we'll announce locations for somewhere between twoand four Gigafactories later this year
409," Yeah, probably four"
410, We need to address a global market
411," Well, I think that first of all, I'm just on two advisory councils where the format consistsof going around the room and asking people's opinion on things, and so there's like a meetingevery month or two"
412, That's the sum total of my contribution
413," But I think to the degreethat there are people in the room who are arguing in favorof doing something about climate change, or social issues, I've used the meetings I've had thus far to argue in favor of immigrationand in favor of climate change"
414,"  And if I hadn't done that, that wasn't on the agenda before"
415," So maybe nothing will happen,but at least the words were said"
416, It took a long time
417, So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back fromvery high and fast in space
418, So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity
419," I think this might have beenat sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage"
420, That was the slowed down version
421, We're at eight or nine
422," Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight againand flew it again, so it's the first reflightof an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant"
423, So it's important to appreciatethat reusability is only relevant if it is rapid and complete
424," So like an aircraft or a car, the reusability is rapid and complete"
425, You do not send your aircraftto Boeing in-between flights
426," Well, visuallyyou can see that's a person"
427," Yeah, and that's the vehicle"
428," Probably a little more, yeah"
429,"  In units of 747, a 747 is only abouta quarter of a million pounds of thrust, so for every 10 million pounds of thrust, there's 40 747s"
430," So this would be the thrust equivalentof 120 747s, with all engines blazing"
431, I'm hopeful it's sort ofan eight- to 10-year time frame
432," Aspirationally, that's our target"
433," While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparisonwith other rockets, I think the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat"
434, The future spaceshipswill be truly enormous
435, I think it's important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing
436, I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morningand you want to live
437," Like, why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we're not out there, if the future does not includebeing out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it's incredibly depressing if that's not the futurethat we're going to have"
438," It's like a branchingstream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can takethat affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thingor slow down another thing"
439, I may introduce something newto the probability stream
440, Sustainable energywill happen no matter what
441," If there was no Tesla,if Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity"
442," If you don't have sustainable energy,it means you have unsustainable energy"
443," Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economicswill drive civilization towards sustainable energy, inevitably"
444," The fundamental valueof a company like Tesla is the degree to which it acceleratesthe advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur"
445," So when I think, like, what is the fundamental goodof a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade,potentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur"
446, That's what I consider to be the fundamentalaspirational good of Tesla
447, Then there's becoming a multiplanetspecies and space-faring civilization
448, This is not inevitable
449, It's very important to appreciatethis is not inevitable
450," The sustainable energy futureI think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilizationis definitely not inevitable"
451," If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 you were ableto send somebody to the moon"
452, Then we had the Space Shuttle
453, The Space Shuttle could onlytake people to low Earth orbit
454," Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United Statescould take no one to orbit"
455, So that's the trend
456, The trend is like down to nothing
457, People are mistaken when they think that technologyjust automatically improves
458, It does not automatically improve
459," It only improves if a lot of peoplework very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think,by itself degrade, actually"
460," You look at great civilizationslike Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that"
461," And then the Romans,they built these incredible aqueducts"
462, They forgot how to do it
463," I think the valueof beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question"
464, But I want to be clear
465, I'm not trying to be anyone's savior
466," But you'll tell me if it everstarts getting genuinely insane, right? "
467, Thank you very much for having me
468, I look forward to talking about the SpaceX Mars architecture
469," And what I really want to achieve here is to make Mars seem possible, make it seem as though it's something that we can do in our lifetimes and that you can go"
470, And is there really a way that anyone can go if they wanted to? I think that's really the important thing
471," So, I mean, first of all, why go anywhere? Right? I think there are really two fundamental paths"
472, History is going to bifurcate along two directions
473, One path is we stay on Earth forever and then there will be some eventual extinction event
474," I don't have an immediate doomsday prophecy, but eventually history suggests there will be some doomsday event"
475," The alternative is to become a space-faring civilization and a multiplanet species, which I hope you agree that is the right way to go"
476, That's what we want
477, So we're currently in the third little rock from the left
478, And our goal is to go to the fourth rock on the left
479," But you can get a sense for the real scale of the solar system, how big the sun is and Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus"
480, And then the little guys on the right are Pluto and friends
481," This sort of helps to see, it's not quite to scale, but it gives you a better sense for where things are"
482," We have, in terms of nearby options, we've got Venus"
483, So that would be a tricky one
484, Venus is not at all like the goddess
485, This is not in no way similar to the actual goddess
486, So it is really difficult to make things work on Venus
487, Mercury is also way too close to the sun
488," We could go potentially on to one of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn, but those are quite far out, much further from the sun, a lot harder to get to"
489," Really, it leaves us with one option if we want to become a multiplanet civilization, and that's Mars"
490," We could conceivably go to our moon, and I have nothing against going to the moon, but I think it's challenging to become multiplanetary on the moon because it's much smaller than a planet"
491, It doesn't have any atmosphere
492, It's not as resource rich as Mars
493," It has a 28-day day, whereas the Mars day is 24 1/2 hours"
494," And in general, Mars is far better suited to ultimately scale up to a self-sustaining civilization"
495," In fact, we now believe that early Mars was a lot like Earth"
496," So, where things are right now, Mars is about half again as far from the sun as Earth"
497, So it has decent sunlight
498," It's a little cold, but we can warm it up"
499," It has a very helpful atmosphere which, in the case of Mars being primarily CO2 with some nitrogen and argon and a few other trace elements, means that we can grow plants on Mars just by compressing the atmosphere"
500," And it has nitrogen, too, which is also very important for growing plants"
501," It will be quite fun to be on Mars, because you will have gravity which is about 37% that of Earth, so you will be able to lift heavy things and bound around and have a lot of fun"
502, And the day is remarkably close to that of Earth
503," So we just need to change that bottom row, because currently we have 7 billion people on Earth and zero on Mars"
504," So there's been a lot of great work by NASA and other organizations in early exploration of Mars and understanding what Mars is like, where could we land, what's the composition of the atmosphere, where is there water, or ice, we should say"
505, And we need to go from these early exploration missions to actually building a city
506," The issue that we have today is that if you look at a Venn diagram, there's no intersection of sets of people who want to go and can afford to go"
507," In fact, right now you cannot go to Mars for infinite money"
508," Using traditional methods, you know, if taking sort of a holistic style approach, an optimistic cost number would be about $10 billion per person"
509," For example, the Apollo program, the cost estimates are somewhere between $100 billion to $200 billion in current-year dollars, and we sent 12 people to the surface of the moon, which was an incredible thing and I think probably one of the greatest achievements of humanity"
510, That's why these circles only just barely touch
511, So you can't create a self-sustaining civilization if the ticket price is $10 billion a person
512," And if we can get the cost of moving to Mars to be roughly equivalent to a median house price in the U.S., which is around $200,000, then I think the probability of establishing a self-sustaining civilization is very high"
513," In fact, I think a relatively small number of people from Earth would want to go"
514, But enough would want to go and who could afford the trip that it would happen
515, And people could get sponsorship
516," And I think it gets to the point where almost anyone, if they saved up and this was their goal, they could ultimately save up enough money to buy a ticket and move to Mars"
517, And Mars would have labor shortage for a long time so jobs would not be in short supply
518, But it is a bit tricky because we have to figure out how to improve the cost of trips to Mars by 5 million percent
519, This translates to an improvement of approximately 4 1/2 orders of magnitude
520, These are the key elements that are needed in order to achieve the 4 1/2 order of magnitude improvement
521," Most of the improvement would come from full reusability, somewhere between 2 and 2 1/2 orders of magnitude"
522," And then the other two orders of magnitude would come from refilling in orbit, propellant production on Mars and choosing the right propellant"
523, So I'm going to go into detail on all of those
524, Full reusability is really the super hard one
525," It's very difficult to achieve reusability for even an orbital system, and that challenge becomes even substantially greater for a system that has to go to another planet"
526," You could say a car, bicycle, horse"
527," If they were single-use, almost no one would use them"
528, It would be too expensive
529," But with frequent flights, you can take something like an aircraft that costs $90 million and if it was single use, you would have to pay half a million dollars per flight"
530, But you can actually buy a ticket on Southwest right now from L.A
531," to Vegas for $43, including taxes"
532, Right there it's showing a four order of magnitude improvement
533, So you get to use the spaceship part roughly every two years
534," Now, you get to use the booster and the tanker as frequently as you'd like"
535," So as I said, refilling in orbit is one of the essential elements of this"
536," Without refilling in orbit, you would have a half order of magnitude impact roughly on the cost"
537," By ""half order of magnitude,"" I think the audience mostly knows, but what that means is each order of magnitude is a factor of ten"
538," So not refilling in orbit would mean a 500%, roughly, increase in the cost per ticket"
539," It also allows us to build a smaller vehicle and lower the development cost, although this vehicle is quite big"
540, But it would be much harder to build something that's five to ten times the size
541, And it also reduces the sensitivity of performance characteristics of the booster rocket and tanker
542," So if there's a shortfall in the performance of any of the elements, you can actually make up for it by having one or two extra refilling trips to the spaceship"
543, And then producing propellants on Mars is actually also very obviously important
544, So 500% increase in the cost of the trip
545, And it would be pretty absurd to try to build a city on Mars if your spaceships just kept staying on Mars and not going back to Earth
546," you would have this, like, massive graveyard of ships"
547," You would have to, like, do something with them"
548, You really want to build a propellant plant on Mars and send the ships back
549," So and Mars happens to work out well for that because it has a CO2 atmosphere, it's got water rights in the soil, and with H2O and CO2 you can produce CH4, methane, and oxygen, O2"
550, So picking the right propellant is also important
551, Think of this as maybe there's three main choices
552," And they have their merits, but kerosene or rocket propellant-grade kerosene which is also what jets use"
553, Rockets use a very expensive form of highly refined form of jet fuel essentially which is a form of kerosene
554," It helps keep the vehicle size small, but because it's a very specialized form of jet fuel, it's quite expensive"
555, Your reusability potential is lower
556," Very difficult to make this on Mars, because there's no oil"
557, So really quite difficult to make the propellant on Mars
558, And then propellant transfer is pretty good but not great
559," Hydrogen, although it has a high specific impulse, is very expensive, incredibly difficult to keep from boiling off because liquid hydrogen is very close to absolute zero as a liquid"
560," So when we looked at the overall system optimization, it was clear to us that methane actually was the clear winner"
561, So it would require maybe anywhere from 50 to 60% of the energy on Mars to refill propellants using the propellant depot
562, And just the technical challenges are a lot easier
563," And we started off initially thinking that hydrogen would make sense, but ultimately came to the conclusion that the best way to optimize the cost per unit mass to Mars and back is to use an all-methane system, or technically deep-cryo Methalox"
564, So those are the four elements that need to be achieved
565, This is a simulation about the overall system
566, So what you saw there is really quite close to what we will actually build
567, So this is not an artist's impression
568, The simulation was actually made from the SpaceX engineering CAD models
569, This is what we plan to try to make it look like
570," In the video, you got a sense for what this system mock architecture looks like"
571," The rocket booster and the spaceship take off, loads the spaceship into orbit"
572, The rocket booster then comes back
573," It comes back quite quickly, within about 20 minutes"
574, So they look almost identical
575," This also helps slow the development cost, which obviously will not be small"
576, And then the propellant tanker goes up
577," Now, over time there would be many spaceships"
578," You would ultimately have, I think, upwards of a thousand or more spaceships waiting in orbit"
579, And so the Mars colonial fleet would depart en masse
580," Kind of like Battlestar Galactica, if you have seen that thing"
581, So it's a bit like that
582, But it actually makes sense to load the spaceships into orbit because you have got two years to do so and then make frequent use of the booster and the tanker to get really heavy reuse out of those
583," And then with the spaceship you get less reuse because you have to prepare for how long is it going to last? Well, maybe 30 years"
584, So that might be 12 to maybe 15 flights with the spaceship at most
585, So you really want to maximize the cargo of the spaceship and use the booster and the tanker a lot
586," So the ship goes to Mars, gets replenished, and then returns to Earth"
587, This is to give you a sense of size
588, It's quite big
589," The funny thing is in the long-term, the ships will be even bigger than this"
590, This will be relatively small compared to the Mars interplanetary ships of the future
591," But it kind of needs to be about this size because in order to fit a hundred people or thereabouts in the pressurized section plus carry the luggage and all of the unpressurized cargo to build propellant plants and build everything from iron foundries to pizza joints to you name it, we need to carry a lot of cargo"
592," If you only go every two years, if you have a hundred people per ship, that's 10,000 trips"
593," So I think at least a hundred people per trip is the right order of magnitude, and I think we may actually end up expanding the crew section and ultimately taking more like 200 or more people per flight in order to reduce the cost per person"
594, So you really want ultimately on the order of a thousand ships
595, It will take a while to build up to a thousand ships
596," And so I think if you say, When would we reach that million-person threshold? From the point at which the first ship goes to Mars, it's probably somewhere between 20 to 50 total Mars rendezvous"
597, So it's probably somewhere between maybe 40 to 100 years to achieve a fully self-sustaining civilization on Mars
598, So that's sort of the cross-section of the ship
599," In some way, it's not that complicated, really"
600, It's made primarily of an advanced carbon fiber
601, The carbon fiber part is tricky when dealing with deep cryogens and trying to achieve both liquid and gas impermeability and not have gaps occur due to cracking or pressurization that would make the carbon fiber leaky
602," So this is a fairly significant technical challenge, to make deep and cryogenic tanks out of carbon fiber"
603," And it's only recently that we think the carbon fiber technology has gotten to the point where we can actually do this without having to create a liner, some sort of metal liner, quad liner on the inside of the tanks, which would add mass and complexity"
604, It's particularly tricky for the hot gaseous oxygen pressurization
605," So this is designed to be autogenously pressurized, which means that the fuel and the oxygen, we gasify them through heat exchanges in the engine and use that to pressurize the tanks"
606, So we will gasify the methane and use that to pressurize the fuel tank
607, Gasify the oxygen
608, Use that to pressurize the oxygen tank
609," This is a much simpler system than what we have with Falcon 9, where we use helium for pressurization and we use nitrogen for gas thrusters"
610," In this case, we would autogenously pressurize and then use gaseous methane and oxygen for the control thrusters"
611," So really, you only need two ingredients for this, as opposed to four in the case of Falcon 9 and actually five if you consider the ignition liquid"
612, It's sort of a complicated liquid to ignite the engines
613, That isn't very usable
614, In this case we would use spark ignition
615," So this gives you a sense of vehicles by performance, sort of current and historic"
616, I don't know if you can actually read that
617," But in expandable mode, the vehicle, of course, we are proposing would do about 550 tons and about 300 tons in reusable mode"
618, That compares to satisfy max capability of 135 tons
619, But I think this really gives a better sense of things
620," The white bars show the performance of the vehicle; in other words, the payload-to-orbit of the vehicle"
621, So you can see essentially what it represents is what's the size efficiency of the vehicle
622, So it's the first time a rocket's sort of performance bar will actually exceed the physical size of the rocket
623, This gives you a more direct sort of comparison
624, So it's quite tectonic when it takes off
625," And in the future, we expect to add additional launch locations, probably adding one on the south coast of Texas"
626," But this gives you a sense of the relative capability, if you can read those"
627, But these vehicles have very different purposes
628," This is really intended to carry huge numbers of people, ultimately millions of tons of cargo to Mars"
629, So you really need something quite large in order to do that
630, So talk about some of the key elements of the interplanetary spaceship and rocket booster
631, We decided to start off the development with what we think are probably the two most difficult elements of the design
632, One is the Raptor engine
633, And this is going to be the highest chamber pressure engine of any kind ever built and probably the highest thrust-to-weight
634, It's a full-flow staged combustion engine which maximizes the theoretical momentum that you can get out of a given source fuel and oxidizer
635, We subcool the oxygen and methane to densify it
636," In our case, we actually build the propellants close to their freezing point"
637," That can result in a density improvement of up to around 10 to 12%, which makes an enormous difference in the actual results of the rocket"
638," Really one of the keys here, though, is the vacuum version of Raptor having a 382-second ISP"
639, This is really quite critical too to the whole Mars mission
640," And we can get to that number or at least within a few seconds of that number, ultimately maybe exceeding it slightly"
641, So the rocket booster in many ways is really a scaled-up version of the Falcon 9 booster
642," You will see a lot of similarities, such as the grid fins"
643, Obviously clustering a lot of engines at the base
644, And the big difference really being that the primary structure is an advanced form of carbon fiber as opposed to limited lithium and that we use autogenous pressurization and get rid of the helium and the nitrogen
645, So this uses 42 Raptor engines
646," It's a lot of engines, but we use an I.N"
647, on the Falcon 9
648," And with Falcon Heavy, which should launch early next year, there's 27 engines on the base"
649, So we've got pretty good experience with having a large number of engines
650, It also gives us redundancies
651," So that if some of the engines fail, you can still continue the mission and be fine"
652, But the main job of the booster is to accelerate the spaceship to around 8 1/2 thousand kilometers an hour
653," For those that are less familiar with orbital dynamics, really it's all about velocity and not about height"
654, So really that's the job of the booster
655, The booster is like the javelin thrower
656," You've got to toss that javelin, which is the spaceship"
657," But for most of the solar system, you only need the spaceship"
658, So you don't need the booster if you have a lower gravity well
659, No booster is needed on the moon or Mars or any of the moons of Jupiter or Pluto
660, You just need the spaceship
661, The booster is just there for heavy gravity wells
662, And then we've also been able to optimize the propellant needed for boost-back and landing to get it down to about 7% of the liftoff prop propellant load
663, We think with some optimization maybe we can get it down to about 6%
664, And we also are now getting quite comfortable with the accuracy of the landing
665," If you have been watching the Falcon 9 landings, you will see that they are getting increasingly closer too to the bull's-eye"
666, And then those fins at the base are essentially centering features to take out any minor position mismatch at the launch site
667, So that's what it looks like at the base
668, So we think we only need to gimbal or steer the center cluster of engines
669, There's seven engines in the center cluster
670," And, like, this is all designed so that you could actually lose multiple engines even at liftoff or anywhere in flight and continue the mission safely"
671," So for the spaceship itself, in the top, we have the pressurized compartment"
672, And I'll show you a fly-through of that in a moment
673, And then below that is the liquid oxygen tank
674, The liquid oxygen tank is probably the hardest piece of this whole vehicle because it's got to handle propellant at the coldest level and the tanks themselves actually form the air frame
675," So the air frame structure and the tank structure are combined, as it is in all modern rockets"
676," And in aircraft, for example, the wing is really a fuel tank in wing shape"
677," So it has to take the thrust loads of ascents, the loads of reentry, and then it has to be impermeable to gaseous oxygen, which is tricky, and non-reactive to gaseous oxygen"
678," So that's the hardest piece of the spaceship itself, which is actually why we started on that element as well"
679, And I'll show you some pictures of that later
680," And then below the oxygen tank is the fuel tank, and then the engines are mounted directly to the thrust cone on the base"
681, And then there are three of the sea-level versions of the engine which do gimbal and provide the steering
682, Although we can do some amount of steering if you're in space with differential thrust on the outside engines
683," The net effect is a cargo to Mars of up to 450 tons, depending upon how many refills you do with the tanker"
684, And the goal is at least 100 passengers per ship
685, Although I think we will see that number grow to 200 or more
686," This chart is a little difficult to interpret at first, but we decided to put it there for people who wanted to watch the video afterwards and sort of take a closer look and analyze some of the numbers"
687, The column on the left is probably what's most relevant
688, And that gives you the trip time
689," So depending upon which Earth-Mars rendezvous you are aiming for, the trip time at 6 kilometers per second departure blast speed can be as low as 80 days"
690," And then over time, I think we could probably improve that"
691," Ultimately, I suspect that you would see Mars transit times of as little as 30 days in the more distant future"
692," It's fairly manageable, considering the trips that people used to do in the old days would routinely take sailing voyages that would be six months or more"
693," So on arrival, the heat shield technology is extremely important"
694, We have been refining the heat shield technology using our Dragon spacecraft
695," We are now on version 3 of PICA, which is the phenolic-impregnated carbon ablator"
696," And it's getting more and more robust with each new version, with less ablation, more resistance, less need for refurbishment"
697, The heat shield is basically a giant brake pad
698, How it's like how good can you make that brake pad against the extreme conditions and the cost of refurbishment and make it so you could have many flights with no refurbishment at all
699, This is a fly-through of the crew compartment
700, I just want to give you a sense of what it would feel like to actually be in the spaceship
701," I mean, in order to make it appealing and increase that portion of the Venn diagram of people who actually want to go, it's got to be really fun and exciting, and it can't feel cramped or boring"
702," But the crew compartment or the occupant compartment is set up so you can do zero-G things, you can float around"
703," It would be like movies, ElectroPuls, cabins, a restaurant"
704," It will be, like, really fun to go"
705, You are going to have a great time
706," So the propellant plant on Mars, again, this is one of those slides that I won't go into in detail here, but people can take that offline"
707," The key point being that the ingredients are there on Mars to create a propellant plant with relative ease, because the atmosphere is primarily CO2 and there's water ice almost everywhere"
708, You've got the CO2 plus H2O to make methane CH4 and oxygen O2 using the Sabatier reaction
709," The trickiest thing really is the energy source, which think we can do with a large field of solar panels"
710," So then to give you a sense of the cost, really the key is making this affordable to almost anyone who wants to go"
711," And we think, based on this architecture, this architecture, assuming optimization over time, like the very first flights would be fairly expensive"
712," So we're right now estimating about $140,000 per ton to the trips to Mars"
713," So if a person plus their luggage is less than that, take into account food consumption and life support, then we think that the cost of moving to Mars ultimately could drop below $100,000"
714," So funding, talking about funding sources"
715," So we have steel underpants; launch satellites; send cargo to space station; Kickstarter, of course; followed by profit"
716, So obviously it's going to be a challenge to fund this whole endeavor
717," We do expect to generate pretty decent net cash flow from launching lots of satellites and serving the space station for NASA, transferring cargo to and from space station, and then I know there's a lot of people in the private sector who are interested in helping fund a base on Mars and then perhaps there will be interest on the government sector side to also do that"
718," Ultimately, this is going to be a huge public-private partnership"
719, So I think that's probably what occurs
720, And right now we're just trying to make as much progress as we can with the resources that we have available and just sort of keep moving both forward
721, And I should say also the main reason I'm personally accumulating assets is in order to fund this
722, So I really don't have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets except to be able to make the biggest contribution I can to making life multiplanetary
723, Not the best at this sort of thing
724, But just to show you where we started off
725," In 2002, SpaceX basically consisted of carpet and a mariachi band"
726, That was it
727, That's all of SpaceX in 2002
728," As you can see, I'm a dancing machine"
729," And, yeah, I believe in kicking off celebratory events with mariachi bands"
730, I really like mariachi bands
731, But that was what we started off with in 2002
732," And really, I mean, I thought we had maybe a 10% chance of doing anything, of even getting a rocket to orbit, let alone getting beyond that and taking Mars seriously"
733," But I came to the conclusion if there wasn't some new entrant into the space arena with a strong ideological motivation, then it didn't seem like we were on a trajectory to ever be a space-faring civilization and be out there among the stars"
734," Because, you know, in '69 we were able to go to the moon and the space shuttle could get to low-Earth orbit, and then after the space shuttle got retired"
735, But that trend line is down to zero
736, So I think what a lot of people don't appreciate is that technology does not automatically improve
737, It only improves if a lot of really strong engineering talent is applied to the problem that it improves
738, And there are many examples in history where civilizations have reached a certain technology level and then have fallen well below that and then recovered only millennia later
739," So we dropped the main engine, the upper stage engine, the air frames, the fairing and the launch system and had our first attempt at launch in 2006, which failed"
740," So that lasted about 60 seconds, unfortunately"
741," But it's 2006, four years after starting, is also when we actually got our first NASA contract"
742," And I just want to say I'm incredibly grateful to NASA for supporting SpaceX, you know, despite the fact that our rocket crashed"
743," Of course, I'm NASA's biggest fan"
744," So, you know, thank you very much to the people that had the faith to do that"
745," So then 2006, followed by a lot of grief"
746," And then, finally, the fourth launch of Falcon 1 worked in 2008"
747, And we were really down to our last pennies
748," In fact, I only thought I had enough money for three launches and the first three bloody failed"
749, And we were able to scrape together enough to just barely make it and do a fourth launch
750, And thank goodness that fourth launch succeeded in 2008
751, That was a lot of pain
752," And then also at the end of 2008 is when NASA awarded us the first major operational contract, which was for resupplying cargo to the space station and bringing cargo back"
753," Then a couple years later we did the first launch of Falcon 9, version 1"
754, And that had about a 10-ton-to-orbit capability
755," So it was about 20 times the capability of Falcon 1, and also was assigned to carry our Dragon spacecraft"
756, Then 2010 is our first mission to the space station
757, So we were able to finish development of Dragon and dock with the space station in 2010
758, 2012 is when we delivered and returned cargo from the space station
759, 2013 is when we first started doing boat take-off and landing tests
760, And then 2014 is when we were able to have the first orbital booster do a soft landing in the ocean
761, The landing was soft
762, The (inaudible) exploded
763, And we also improved the capability of the vehicle from 10 tons to about 13 tons to LEO
764," And then 2015, last year, in December, that was definitely one of the best moments of my life when the rocket booster came back and landed at Cape Canaveral"
765, That was really ..
766, So that really showed that we could bring an orbit-class booster back from a very high velocity all the way to the launch site and land it safely and with almost no refurbishment required for reflight
767," And if things go well, we're hoping to refly one of the landed boosters in a few months"
768, The landing on the ship is important for the very high-velocity geosynchronous missions
769, And that's important for reusability of Falcon 9 because about roughly a quarter of our missions are sort of servicing the space station
770, But then there's a few other low-Earth-orbit missions
771," But most of our missions, probably 60% of our missions, are commercial geo missions"
772, So we've got to do these high-velocity missions that really need to land on a ship out to sea
773, They don't have enough propellants on board to boost back to the launch site
774," So looking into the future, next steps, we were kind of intentionally a bit fuzzy about this time line"
775, But we were going to try to make as much progress as we can
776," Obviously, it's with a very constrained budget"
777," But we are going to try to make as much progress as we can on the elements of interplanetary transport booster and spaceship, and hopefully we'll be able to complete the first development spaceship in maybe about four years and start doing suborbital flights with that"
778," In fact, it has enough capability that you could maybe even go to orbit if you limit the amount of cargo with the spaceship"
779," But in tanker form, it could definitely get to orbit"
780," It can't get back, but it can get to orbit"
781," Actually, I was thinking like maybe there is some market for really fast transport of stuff around the world, provided we can land somewhere where noise is not a super big deal, because rockets are very noisy"
782, But we could transport cargo to anywhere on Earth in 45 minutes at the longest
783," So most places on Earth would be maybe 20, 25 minutes"
784," Really most of your time would be getting to the ship, and then it would be real quick after that"
785, So there's some intriguing possibilities there
786," Although, we're not counting on that"
787," But then trying to put it all together and make this actually work to Mars, if things go super well, it might be kind of in the ten-year time frame"
788, But I don't want to say that's when it will occur
789," It's, like, this huge amount of risk"
790, It's going to cost a lot
791," Good chance we don't succeed, but we're going to do our best and try to make as much progress as possible"
792, And we're going to try to send something to Mars on every Mars rendezvous from here on out
793," So Dragon 2, which is a propulsive lander, we plan to send to Mars in a couple years, and then do probably another Dragon mission in 2020"
794," In fact, we want to establish a steady cadence, that there's always a flight leaving, like there's a train leaving the station"
795," So if there's a lot of interest in putting payloads on Dragon, you know you can count on a ship that's going to transport something on the order of at least two or three tons of useful payloads to the surface of Mars"
796," That's part of the reason we designed Dragon 2, to be a propulsive lander"
797," As a propulsive lander, you can go anywhere in the solar system"
798, So you can go to the moon
799," And then anyplace that doesn't have a dense atmosphere, you can't use parachutes"
800, But propulsive works anywhere
801, So the Dragon should be capable of landing on any solid or liquid surface in the solar system
802," I just want to say thanks to the Raptor team for really working seven days a week to try to get this done in advance of the presentation, because I really wanted to show that we've made some hardware progress in this direction"
803, And the Raptor is a really tricky engine
804," It's a lot trickier than Merlin because it's a full-flow stage combustion, much higher pressure"
805, I'm kind of amazed it didn't blow up on the first firing
806," Fortunately, it was good"
807, It's kind of interesting to see the mock diamonds forming
808," And part of the reason for making the engine sort of small, Raptor, although it has three times the thrust of a Merlin is only about the same size as a Merlin engine because it has three times the operating pressure"
809, That means we can use a lot of the production techniques that we've honed with Merlin
810, We are currently producing Merlin engines at almost 300 per year
811, So we understand how to make rocket engines in volume
812, And this is a similarly sized engine to Merlin except for the expansion ratio
813, So we feel really comfortable about being able to make this engine in volume at a price that doesn't break our budget
814, We also wanted to make progress on the primary structure
815," So, as I mentioned, this is really a very difficult thing to make, to make something out of carbon fiber"
816," Just the sheer scale of it is also challenging, because you've got to lay out the carbon fiber in exactly the right way on a huge mold, and you've got to cure that mold at temperature"
817, So that's the other thing we want to focus on is the Raptor and then building the first development tank for the Mars spaceship
818, So this is really the hardest part of the spaceship
819, The other pieces we have a pretty good handle on
820, But this was the trickiest one
821, We wanted to tackle it first
822," You get a size for how big the tank is, which is really quite big"
823, Also big congratulations to the team that worked on that
824, They were also working seven days a week to try to get this done in advance of the IAC
825," We managed to build the first tank, and the initial tests with the cryogenic propellants actually look quite positive"
826, We have not seen any leaks or major issues
827, This is what the tank looks like on the inside
828, So you can get a real sense for just how big this tank is
829," It's actually completely smooth on the inside, but the way that the carbon fiber plies lay out and reflect the light makes it look faceted"
830," There's obviously the rocket booster, the spaceship, the tanker, and the propellant plant, the in situ propellant production"
831," If you have all of those four elements, you can actually go anywhere in the solar system by planet hopping or moon hopping"
832, So you can actually travel out to the Kuiper belt or the Earth cloud
833,"Sure, first of all, thank you for having me"
834, It’s an honor to be here
835, And I’m having a really great time with my kids in Dubai
836, It’s really been fantastic
837," I really encourage anyone who hasn’t been to visit, what a great city! Thank you"
838,"And, in terms of the motivations, I used to like this sort of… kind of a long version of the explanation but… essentially, when I was a kid I was wondering, what’s the meaning of life? Like, why are we here? What is it all about? And I came to the conclusion that what really matters is trying to understand the right questions to ask"
839," And the more that we can increase the scope and scale of human consciousness, the better we’re able to ask these questions"
840," And… So, I think there are certain things that are necessary to ensure that the future is good"
841, And… some of those things are in the long term having long term sustainable transport and sustainable energy generation
842, And to be a space exploring civilization
843, And for humanity to be out there among the stars
844, And be a multi-planetary species
845, I think that being a multi-planetary species and being out there among the stars is important for the long-term survival of humanity
846," And, that’s one reason, kind of like life insurance for life collectively"
847, Life as we know it
848," But then the part that I find personally most motivating is that it creates a sense of adventure, and it makes people excited about the future"
849," If you consider two futures, one where we are forever confined to Earth until eventually something terrible happens"
850," Or another future where we are out there on many planets, maybe even going beyond the solar system"
851, I think that space invasion is incredibly exciting and inspiring
852, And there need to be reasons to get up in the morning
853," You know, life can’t just be about solving problems"
854," Otherwise, what’s the point? There’s got to be things that people find inspiring and make life worth living"
855,I find that as I get older I find that question to be maybe more and more confusing or troubling or uncertain
856, Particularly when you see the advancement of something like video games
857," You know, 40 years ago, you had video games, the most advanced video game would be like Pong, when you had two rectangles and a dot"
858, And you’re like batting it back and forth
859," Yeah, we both played the same game"
860, And that was like a pretty fun game at the time
861," But now, you can see a video game that’s photo-realistic, almost photo-realistic, and millions of people playing simultaneously"
862," And, and you see where things are going with virtual reality"
863," And augmented reality and… if you extrapolate that out into the future with any rate of progress at all, like keeping 0.1% of something like that a year, then eventually those games will be indistinguishable from reality"
864, They’ll be so realistic you won’t be able to tell the difference between that game and reality as we know it
865," And then, it seems like, well, how do we know that that didn’t happen in the past? And that we’re not in one of those games ourselves"
866,"Well, I think this is one of those things that are quite difficult to predict"
867," When you think of, say, the first controlled power flight was in 1903 with the Wright Brothers"
868," And then, 66 years later we put the first people on the moon"
869," I mean, if you asked people, say, in 1900, what are the odds of landing on the moon they would’ve said that’s ridiculous"
870," If you try to talk to them about the internet they wouldn’t know what the heck you’re even… What are you talking about? Like, this sounds so crazy"
871," But today, with a hundred-dollar device you can video-conference with anyone in the world"
872," On the other side of the world, and if you have a Wi-Fi connection, it’s basically free"
873," You’re free to have an instant visual communication with anyone, or even with millions of people"
874," You know, with social media you can communicate to millions of people simultaneously"
875," So, and you can google something and ask any question"
876," It’s like an oracle of wisdom, that you can ask almost any questions and get an instant response"
877, It would be incredibly difficult to predict these things in the past
878, Even the relatively recent past
879," So, I think the one thing that we can be quite certain of is that any predictions we make today for what the future will be like in 50 years will be wrong That’s for sure"
880," I think directionally, I can tell you what I hope the future has, as opposed to maybe what it will be"
881, This may just be wishful thinking
882,"I mean I hope we are out there on Mars and maybe beyond Mars, Jupiter"
883," I hope we’re traveling frequently throughout the solar system, perhaps preparing for missions to nearby star systems"
884, I think all of that is possible in 50 years
885, And I think it’s going to be very exciting to do that
886," And, I think we’ll see autonomy and artificial intelligence advance tremendously"
887, Like that’s actually quite near term
888," My guess is in probably 10 years, it will be very unusual for cars to be built that are not fully autonomous"
889, I think almost all cars built will be able of full autonomy in about 10 years
890," As it is, the Tesla cars that are made today, have the sensor system necessary for full autonomy"
891, And we think probably enough compute power to be safer than a person
892," So, it’s mostly just the question of developing the software and uploading the software"
893," And if it turns out that more compute power is needed, we can easily upgrade the computer"
894," And, so that’s all Teslas built since October last year"
895, And other manufacturers will follow and do the same thing
896," So, getting in a car will be like getting in an elevator"
897," You just tell it where you want to go, and it takes you there with extreme levels of safety"
898," And that will be normal, that will just be normal"
899," Like, for elevators, they used to be elevator operators"
900," You get in, there will be a guy moving a lever"
901," Now, you just get in, you press the button and that’s taken for granted"
902," So, autonomy will be wide-spread"
903,I think one of the most troubling questions is artificial intelligence
904," And I don’t mean narrow AI, like, vehicle autonomy I would put in the narrow AI class"
905, It’s narrowly trying to achieve a certain function
906," But deep artificial intelligence, or what is sometimes called artificial general intelligence, where you can have AI that is much smarter than the smartest human on Earth"
907," This, I think, is a dangerous situation"
908,"Well, digital super intelligence will be like an alien"
909," But my question is, do you think there is other intelligent life outside the Earth? It seems probable"
910," I think this is one of the great questions in physics and philosophy, is, where are the aliens? Maybe they are among us, I don’t know"
911, Some people think I’m an alien
912,"Well, that’s a really tough one to say"
913," If there are super intelligent aliens out there, they’re probably already observing us"
914, That would seem quite likely and we’re not smart enough to realize it
915," But I can do some back of the envelope calculations and… any advanced alien civilization that is at all interested in populating the galaxy, even without exceeding the speed of light, even if you’re only moving at, say, 10 or 20 per cent of the speed of light, you could populate the entire galaxy in let’s say 10 million years"
916, Maybe 20 million years max
917, This is nothing in the grand scheme of things
918,"To be clear, I don’t want to die on Mars"
919," It’s like, if… we’re all going to die someday, and if you’re going to pick some place to die, then why not Mars? You know, if you’re born on Earth, why not die on Mars? Seems like may be quite exciting"
920," But, I think given the choice between dying on Earth and dying on Mars, I’d say, yeah, sure, I’ll die on Mars"
921, But it’s not some kind of Mars death wish
922," And if I do die on Mars, I just don’t want to go on impact"
923," I think this is going to sound a little… I mean, it seems like so much trivial or silly, but… I’ve been saying this for many years now, but I think that the solution to urban congestion is a network of tunnels under cities"
924," And when I say that I don’t mean a 2-D plan of tunnels, I mean tunnels that go many levels deep"
925," So, you can always go deeper than you can go up"
926," Like, the deepest mines are deeper than the tallest buildings"
927," So, you can have a network of tunnels that is 20, 30, 40, 50 levels, as many levels as you want, really"
928," And so, given that, you can overcome the congestion situation in any city in the world"
929," The challenge is how do you build tunnels quickly and at low cost and with high safety? So, if tunnel technology can be improved to the point where you can build tunnels fast, cheap and safe, then that would completely get rid of any traffic situations in the cities"
930," And so, that’s why I think it’s an important technology"
931," And, Washington D.C., L.A and most of the major American cities, most major cities in the world suffer from severe traffic issues"
932," And it’s mostly because you’ve got these buildings which are, these tall buildings that are 3-D and you have a road network that is one level"
933," And then, people generally want to go in and out of these buildings at the exact same time"
934," So, then, you get the traffic jam"
935,"Well, the most near to impact from a technological standpoint is autonomous cars, like fully self-driving cars"
936, I’d say that’s going to happen much faster than people realize
937," so, and that’s… it’s going to be a great convenience to be in an autonomous car, but there are many people whose job is to drive"
938," So, if… in fact I think it might be the single largest employer of people is driving in various forms"
939," And so, then we need to figure out new rules for what do these people do"
940, But it will all be very disruptive and very quick
941, I should characterize what I mean by quick
942, Because there are… Quick means different things to different people
943, There are about two billion vehicles in the world
944, Approaching in fact 2.5 billion cars and trucks in the world
945, The total new vehicle production capacity is about a hundred million
946," Which makes sense, because the life of a car or truck before it’s finally scraped is about 20-25 years"
947," So, so the point at which we see full autonomy appear will not be the point at which there is massive societal upheaval, because it will take a long time to make enough autonomous vehicles to disrupt employment"
948," So, that disruption I’m talking about will take place over about 20 years"
949," Still, 20 years is a short period of time to have I think something like 12 to 15 per cent of the world force be unemployed"
950,"Well, I think the first bit of advice is to really play close attention to… the development of artificial intelligence"
951," I think this is, we need to be just be very careful in… how we adopt artificial intelligence, and to make sure that researchers don’t get carried away, because sometimes what happens is that scientists can get so engrossed in their work, they don’t necessarily realize the ramifications of what they’re doing"
952," So, I think it’s important for public safety that we… you know, governments keep a close eye on artificial intelligence and make sure that it does not represent a danger to the public"
953," Let’s see, secondly, I would say we do need to think about transport in general"
954," And, there’s the movement towards electric vehicles, sustainable transport, I think that’s going to be good for many reasons, but again, not something that happens immediately, that’s going to happen slower than the self-driving vehicles"
955, Because that’s probably something that happens over 30 or 40 years
956, The transition to electric vehicles
957," So, thinking about that in context… the demand for electricity will increase dramatically"
958," So, currently, in terms of total energy usage in the world, it’s about 1/3, about 1/3 transport, about 1/3 heating"
959," So, over time that will transition to almost all… not all, but predominantly electricity, which means that the demand for electricity will probably triple"
960," So, it’s going to be very important to think about, how do you make so much more electricity? And"
961,"No, well, I think maybe… these things do play into each other a little bit, but what to do about mass unemployment? This is going to be a massive social challenge"
962, And I think ultimately will have to have some kind of universal basic income I don’t think we’re going to have a choice
963, I think it’s going to be necessary
964,There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better
965," That’s simply… And I want to be clear, these are not things that I wish would happen"
966, These are simply things that I think probably will happen
967," And so, if my assessment is correct and they probably will happen, then we need to say what are we going to do about it"
968, And I think some kind of universal basic income is going to be necessary
969," Now, the output of goods and services will be extremely high"
970," So, with automation, there will come abundance"
971, There will be… almost everything will get very cheap
972, The… So… I think the biggest… I think we’ll just end up doing a universal basic income
973, It’s going to be necessary
974," The harder challenge, much harder challenge, is how do people then have meaning? Like a lot of people, they derive their meaning from their employment, so, if you don’t have… if you’re not needed, if there’s not a need for your labor, how do you… what’s the meaning? Do you have meaning? Do you feel useless? That’s a much harder problem to deal with"
975, And then how do we ensure that the future is going to be the future that we want? That we so like
976,"You know, I mean do think that there’s a potential path here which is, I’m really getting into science fiction or sort of advanced science stuff"
977," But, having some sort of merger with biological intelligence, and machine intelligence"
978," To some degree, we are already a cyborg"
979," You think of like the digital tools that you have, your phone and your computer, the applications that you have"
980, Like the fact that as I mentioned earlier you can ask a question and instantly get an answer from Google or from other things
981," And, and so you already have a digital touchery layer"
982," I say touchery because you can think of the limbic system, kind of the animal brain or the primal brain and then the cortex, kind of the thinking, planning part of the brain, and then your digital self as a third layer"
983," So, you already have that, and I think if somebody dies, their digital ghost is still around"
984, All of their e-mails and the pictures that they posted and their social media
985," That still lives, even if they died"
986," So, over time I think we’ll probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence"
987," And it’s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and your digital… the digital extension of yourself"
988," Particularly output, and, if anything is getting worse, you know, we used to have keyboards that we used a lot, now we do most of our input through our thumbs, on a phone"
989," And, that’s just very slow"
990," A computer can communicate at a trillion bits per second, but your thumb can maybe do maybe 10 bits per second or a hundred if you’re being generous"
991," So, some high bandwidth interface to the brain I think will be something that helps achieve symbiosis, between human and machine intelligence and maybe solves the control problem and the usefulness problem"
992," I’m getting pretty esoteric here, I don’t know is this is"
993,"Well, I… I think about what technology solution is necessary in order to achieve that particular goal, and then try to make as much progress in that direction as possible"
994," So, in the case of space flight, the critical breakthrough that’s necessary in space flight, is rapid incomplete reusability of rockets"
995, Just as we have for air crafts
996," You can imagine that if an aircraft was a single use, almost no one would fly"
997," Because you can buy like, say, 747 might be… 250 million Dollars, 300 million Dollars, something like that"
998, You need two of them for a round trip
999, But nobody is going to pay millions of Dollars for a ticket to fly
1000, To do air travel
1001," So, but because you can re-use the aircraft tens of thousands of times, the… Air travel becomes much more affordable"
1002," And, the same is true of rockets"
1003," Our rocket costs… 60 million Dollars, roughly"
1004," So, a capital cost if it can be used once in 60 million Dollars"
1005, But if the capital cost if it can be used a thousand times is 60 thousand Dollars
1006," So, then if you can carry a lot of people for a flight, then you can get the cost of space flight to be something not far from the cost of air flight"
1007," So, it’s truly fundamental, because earth gravity is quite deep"
1008, Earth has a fairly high gravity
1009, The difficulty of making a rocket reusable is much greater than the difficulty of making an aircraft reusable
1010, That’s why a fully reusable rocket hasn’t been developed that far
1011," But if you use the most advanced materials, the most advanced design techniques, and you get everything just right, then I’m confident that you can do a fully reusable rocket"
1012," Fortunately, if Earth gravity was even 10 per cent stronger, I would say it wouldn’t be impossible"
1013,"Well, I suppose honestly that it tends to be a gut feeling more than anything else"
1014," So, when I interview somebody, the main questions are always the same"
1015, What do you ask? I say: Tell me the story of your life
1016," And, the decisions that you made along the way and why you made them"
1017," And then, and also tell me about some of the most difficult problems you worked on and how you solved them"
1018," And, that question I think is very important, because… the people that really solved the problem, they know exactly how they solved it"
1019, They know the little details
1020," And the people that pretended to solve the problem, they can maybe go one level and then they get stuck"
1021,I think that probably they shouldn’t want to be
1022," Yeah, it’s not as much fun being me as you’d think"
1023, But it’s… I’m not sure I want to be me
1024," But… You know, I think my advice is if you want to make progress in things, I think that the best analytical framework for, I’ll say in the future is physics"
1025, I’d recommend studying the thinking process around physics
1026," Like, not just the equations, the equations are certainly very helpful, but the way of thinking in physics, it’s the best framework for understanding things that are counter–intuitive"
1027," And, you know, always take the position that you are to some degree wrong, and your goal is to be less wrong over time"
1028, One of the biggest mistakes people generally make and I’m guilty of it too is wishful thinking
1029," You know, like you want something to be true, even if it isn’t true"
1030," And so you ignore the things that… You ignore the real truth, because of what you want to be true"
1031, This is a very difficult trap to avoid
1032," And like I said, it’s certainly one that I find myself in, having problems with"
1033," But, if you just take that approach of that you’re always to some degree wrong and your goal is to be less wrong"
1034," And solicit critical feedback, particularly from friends"
1035," Like, friends, if somebody loves you they want the best for you"
1036, They don’t want to tell you the bad things
1037," So, you have to ask them and say: I do really want to know"
1038, And then they will tell you
